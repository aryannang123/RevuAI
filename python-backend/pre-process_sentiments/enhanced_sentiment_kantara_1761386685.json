It has some excellent acting especially Rishabh who is absolutely outstanding, very good music, excellent period settings and a plot that does its job though it does have its shortcomings. A little better than decent first half followed by a brilliant 2nd half. Possibly the best movie of the year. 8.5 to 9/10\n\nDetails:\n\nThe movie is set many years ago, in the coastal Karnataka",
