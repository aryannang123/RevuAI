# Gemini AI Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup

The AI Summary Generator now uses **Google Gemini API** instead of Hugging Face models for better, more reliable summaries.

### 1. Get Your Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key

### 2. Add API Key to Environment

Open `python-backend/.env` and replace:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

With your actual API key:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyD...your_actual_key_here
```

### 3. Test the Setup

Run the test:
```bash
cd python-backend
python ai_summary_generator.py
```

You should see:
```
✅ Gemini AI loaded successfully!
🧠 Gemini processing sentiment analysis...
📝 Gemini Generated Summary: [intelligent summary]
🤖 Model: google/gemini-pro
```

**If you see "404 models/gemini-pro is not found"**, it means you need to set a valid API key.

## 🎯 Benefits of Gemini
