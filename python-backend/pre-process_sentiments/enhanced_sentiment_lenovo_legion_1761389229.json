For example, you mentioned using performance mode in which the fan speed is at max so you would expect the temps to drop but no they actually drop in quite mode 😂 try that out. This is due to the clock speed of your processor. \n\nRyzen cpus have relatively higher temps due to higher clock speeds but that also means more power.",

Even if you use Affrim to make monthly payments that would be 142.04 a month for 12 Months in total that would be 1700$ with interest…cancelled the preorder after a couple hours lol",
