It doesn't suffer from the \"go the opposite direction\" problem like Elder Scrolls games.\n\nThe decision to give you a large amount of experience and some of the best items to progress as part of the main story also really pushes you forward. Not being \"required\" to do all the sidequests to get most/all the good skills is a good design decision.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my ~60h (wasted at few hours so you can be a lot faster) to platinum with at best a handful of content/hours of that I wouldn't call **very enjoyable**.

From clear visual references to Maria Felix and Mexican history of building architecture over existing architecture to on the nose mentions of Frida Khalo or other major Mexican celebrities at the gala.\n\nAgain, not to underplay the importance of getting down the actual meaning of the holiday, but the movie is so peppered with *meaningful* cultural references that the underlying theme kind of ends up being the cherry on top.\n\nNgl, I still got a bit of beef with the reductionism of \"sombreros and dusty old town\", which I also know is not something many Mexicans care about anyway, but that's a fistful of a sand against the titanic wave of cultural love in that movie.\n\nAaand I kinda digressed from my point there; that having natives give input helps elevate the cultural impact of narrative products."

Then there is that helm and Atsu mentions a herbologists kit for poisons. \n\nI like to think the multiple banners are a reference to collecting the Sashimono banners. There is that Haiku as well which plays out exactly how Haikus did in GoT. Reinforcing the fact that he's hurting but he doesn't regret his sacrifices.\n\nThen yea, the last fight with all the stances and such, it honestly felt fuckin awesome the whole way through, if a lil sad. A beautiful love letter to folks who loved GoT and Jin. \n\nI headcanon that the fox you see is him too, with his mother saying inari was his guardian and all that.\n\nALSO fun fact: there is a Vanity chest on a beach elsewhere in the coast that has the Sakai emblem on it and when opened it gives you the Pirate Revolt Mask. It's description 'A rebellious nature. An ocean crossed. An ending far from home.' which I believe is a reference to Iki Island stuff."

      "text": "Let me play devil's advocate here a second, I think in some ways they make more sense than mid-game DLCs. I'll admit I'm not the biggest DLC guy, even when it's a game I love or a game where it's supposedly the best part. Part of the reason is that when I'm approaching an old game I'm usually of the mind that I should play through the original experience and then decide if I want to check out any additional content. I'm rarely thinking \"man I haven't played this game yet but I bet I'll enjoy it a lot more if it's 60 hours as opposed to 40!\"\n\n\nThe issue with the typical 2/3 of the way through DLC placement (think Horizon Zero Dawn, Bloodborne, Cyberpunk, the new Lies of P) is that that's the place I tend to peter out and need to force myself to finish games. I don't know if other people have this problem but even with my favorite games like Hollow Knight or Bloodborne I sometimes end up kinda abandoning the game for a while and maybe coming back and finishing it much later. I think the issue is that that's the place where I realize I need to either run around the map picking up a bunch of loose ends and side missions or just say fuck it, blast through to the ending so I can move on. And having DLCs right there means I'm even more likely to put it down for a bit. \n\n\nThe worst part though is then if you finish a game, how do you play the DLC? People downvoted me in the Lies of P sub for asking but are you suppose to start a new save file and play through 3/4 of the game just for the DLC, or are you supposed to just have a save that you paused at the right level? I'd rather DLCs be set in the endgame so you avoid that issue altogether."

Now they are restricting sales to only places with PSN just like how they originally planned. \n\nHelldivers 2 is a one-time exception cause the lawyers didn't see a good way to go forward w/o loosing money.

Love lining up the camera after an epic fight and putting my sword away all badass.\n\nEdit: update is out as of typing this, already loving the Lethal difficulty, enemies pick up on you in what seems like more realistic times and distances, stealth seems more useful now, and I have gotten chopped the fuck down by those spear guys like ten times in one hit (seems you pretty much die on one hit by a common enemy now  and they take only one or two hits as well). Feels much more realistic now IMO. Have only had two duels taking my time with photo mode and exploring. From what I've read duels will be quite a challenge considering they were already difficult on Hard. Parry window are also significantly shorter.\n\nAnother note, people seem to have made me aware through other comments in the thread that switching to English gives one more dialogue from Mongols in camps, and even certain lines from Jin. If you're a sucker for worldbuilding details like me, might be worth it to switch back over to English audio.

Then when it released it was user review bombed on metacritic for similar and other reasons (mostly unwarranted). \n\nSo when Ghosts released a month later there was the opposite effect on metacritic with people praising GoT and in that same review would bash The Last of Us 2. Kind of ever since then they’ve been pitted against each other even though imo they are very different games. Overall though they were both very good games and stand on their own. Personally though I enjoyed The Last of Us 2 more and is probably my favorite game of all time."

That way you can play it more like a linear action game. \n\nI'd say the first half of the game is somewhat dull. You start losing track of the story, the combat seems simple.

      "text": "I think people put an insane amount of stock into the technological fidelity of video games and, simply put, we have reached an era where every big budget game will look utterly gorgeous and go to great lengths to animate all kinds of wondrous things. In a way, that *is* marvelous and mastercrafted. Many games are masterpieces on purely technological merit.\n\nHowever, games obviously can be more. Themes, politics, messages, representation, story, world building, the delivery of the world and story, all of these things can absolutely make or break a game. Those are also quite divisive. Nobody can argue against RDR2 not being a beautiful game, but there can be much discussion about the themes explored, the characterisation, the world itself and so on. \n\nThose aspects usually hold back movie critics from giving out 10/10 Masterpiece reviews, because that stuff can be quite subjective. Some might see Al Pacino's acting in \"The Godfather\" as incredibly authentic and beautiful, others might be like \"Ehhh, a liiiittle hammy, but still good\" and so it goes.\n\nGaming critique usually seems to boil down to very shallow surface level critique though. Is Game Pretty? Does Game Do The Good Combat? Does Game Run Good? Is Story Not Totally Idiotic? And on those merits the games are judged and all those merits are relatively easy to fulfill (more or less) these days, because the industry has become extremely advanced and professional. \n\nBut how many reviews do you see where philosophical themes are discussed? How many reviews do you see where the reviewer also comments on the story structure or the framing of the story and those comments are important pillars of the review score? Not that many. Most of that stuff is relegated to nerdy fans making hourlong videos exploring the morality of, say, Fallout: New Vegas' choice system and the framing of it all, and why that makes it a 10/10 game. \n\nVideo game reviewers treat video games on the one side like serious art, but then refuse to be challenged by it or to explore its themes thoroughly, so instead their reviews have all the artistic grace of someone reviewing a new washing machine, or a car. It's all technological merit and maybe a few comments on how the thing does its job and it's quite entertaining.\n\nImagine books being reviewed like video games. \"The cover art is beautiful and the lettering is expertly printed on finely crafted paper. The paper itself is made from a rare type of tree, further adding to the elegance of the novel. The words used within the novel are all very interesting and they have stood the test of time. The story was okay. The print of the letters even dared to be adventurous with the spacing. The author even opted for the curiousity of adding chapter titles! This is a 10/10 novel and I enjoyed my flip-through greatly!\""

Seeing him working on the suit just confirmed it for him. It also seems a little coincidental that Octavius' lab always had odd parts that proved to be useful for upgrades and gadgets and even for a whole new suit and that Octavius came up with ideas for useful upgrades and gadgets so quickly, almost like he'd been setting aside things and ideas that could be helpful for Spider-Man for a while. Octavius treated Peter like his own son and Peter really saw him almost like a surrogate father figure, it makes it all the more depressing seeing how Octavius changed, mainly because he didn't let Peter fix the neural controller for the arms before he started using them."

      "score": 100,
      "text": ">Watazumi Shrine, a real-life Shinto shrine located on Japan’s Tsushima Island, has announced that it will prohibit entry to anyone other than congregants and worshippers starting March 23. According to official announcements posted on Instagram and Threads, the decision to ban all tourists was prompted by “a grave and unforgivable act of disrespect committed by foreigner(s).” \n\n>The Watazumi Shrine is one of the locations on Tsushima Island that gained significant worldwide attention after the release of Sucker Punch Productions’ Ghost of Tsushima in 2020. The shrine is theorized to have inspired the Scarlet Rock Shrine that appears in-game, and Ghost of Tsushima fans famously made large donations to help repair it after it was damaged in a typhoon later in 2020 (source: Famitsu). The crowdfunding campaign launched by the shrine raised 27 million yen (around $180 thousand USD – five times the original target), earning gratitude from the shrine’s priests. \n\n>Unfortunately, the Watazumi Shrine has since gone through several instances of problematic behavior from visitors, which has on one occasion resulted in a controversial ban on visitors from South Korea (source: Tokyo Weekender). And now, a serious incident that occurred on March 22 has prompted the shrine to forbid all tourists from entering the premises. \n\n>Although the shrine’s officials do not offer details about the “grave and unforgivable act of disrespect” that triggered the strict measures, they mention consulting with police on numerous occasions regarding problematic behavior from visitors, including vandalism of the sacred grounds and repeated physical and verbal abuse against staff. Such acts have caused the shrine’s officials “unbearable mental anguish” and have left staff feeling that “management of the shrine is in jeopardy.” \n\n>As a result, Watazumi Shrine has banned visits for touristic purposes, allowing only congregants and worshippers to enter the shrine premises. In addition, the shrine has also banned visitors from taking photos, videos and recording livesteams. In a follow-up post, the shrine’s officials clarified that worshippers who want to take photos will not be refused, emphasizing that “those who consider this place a theme park or simply a photogenic location are not worshippers.” \n\n>Although the notice mentions that tourists from both domestic and international tour buses will be refused entry, the shrine’s officials seem particularly angry with the behavior of foreign tourists, commenting “Inbound tourism’s destruction of places, things, and people cherished by the Japanese is nothing less than the destruction of Japanese culture.”"

GoT was a beautiful game, but you can see the spots where they worked smartly - for instance some cutscenes avoid full facial animations by having the camera pulled at a distance and focused on environment.\n\nAt the same time I think that’s resulted in them struggling to make sequels that are definitively bigger and better than the previous game, and they really haven’t been able to breakthrough into that high 80’s -90’s metacritic range. We’ll see where Yotei falls, but I’m anticipating similar critical reception as the first based on what’s been shown - more of the same and assuredly a good game, but less impactful than the first."

Graphics and world are beautiful. Story took a bit of time but it really cought me in the latter half. Combat was really satisfying and you had many tools at your disposal combined with a interesting skill tree and unlockable abilities. The system with the wind guiding you was really well done in my opinion.Side activities were cool and only became repetitive once you tried to complete everything for me. What really stood out for me was how they depicted the japanese culture and went one step further then many other games. This game is the most solid 9/10 in my opinion. It did nothing spectacularly well, but everything it did implement, it did so at a very high standart. \n\nOn the other hand i could list you 20 reasons why i think TLOU 2 doesn't deserve nearly as much praise as it did. Thats the thing about games and media in general. Take the ratings of the game and put them in a bell curve. There are some who hate it, some who disliked it, the majority really liked it and some absolutely loved it. The ratings are just an indicator, it doesn't mean a game is objectively the best game ever and you will 100% like it. \n\nOh and by the way, stating you were right on expecting a 8/10 and that calling it a masterpiece makes no sense at all makes you come off as incredibly pretentious."

It’s my own fault for not engaging with all of the systems and they clearly had a specific story they wanted to tell, but I just had a really hard time connecting with or getting invested in the story when it was based entirely around my character being accused of things I would actively try to avoid unless the game gave me no other choice."

There's more menuing in this game than in Rise of Ronin or Nioh because your traversal and combat performance is largely tied to the set you're wearing, and there's no way to quick switch them with a hotkey without entering a menu. How did something like this go through playtesting is beyond me, and they are apparently preserving this system unchanged in the sequel (although this can be said about virtually everything in Yotei).\n\nNo matter the difficulty, it's too easy to play a samurai. You can instantly wipe half the encounter before it even begins, and it's far faster to murder entire crowds in open warfare compared to playing around as a ninja. This creates a huge discrepancy with the narrative.\n\nThe combat is braindead. The stances are just glorified rock paper scissors. Yotei, yet again, seems to preserve it, just replacing stances with individual weapons.\n\nThe world is beautiful, but by the beginning of the second act you've already seen and experienced basically everything it can offer. Repetition settles in very quickly.\n\nI ditched asscreed after Black Flag, but decided to give this game a go. It was a beautiful, boring slog."

Even the bland and gray open world of RoR was more bearable thanks to it's amazing combat.\n\nAlso, I didn't like how Tsushima sabotaged it's own premise all the time just to be cool. The point of how the Mongolian army doesn't follow the Bushido code and puts the Samurais on a disadvantage is great, but then they will always accept your 1v1 duels whenever you ask for one? Isn't that exactly what didn't happen in the intro when the Mongolian general set fire to that Samurai?\n\nAlso, you can play all the game as a Samurai following the Bushido code except when the game forces you to Ninja your way out of main quests. Kind of defeats the whole point of Jin's struggles and makes the moments he argues with his Uncle about using Shinobi methods feel unearned."

It's a mostly insignificant thing though.\n\nAlso annoying is that subtitles aren't labeled with Jin's name when he's speaking. So you'll be in a conversation with someone, and their lines are labeled with their name or title (e.g. \"Peasant: Thank you for saving me!\"), but then anything Jin says will just be his line of dialogue but without his name at the beginning. I've actually even seen one of Jin's spoken lines attributed to a peasant, which was a strange bug...\n\n*And* you can't skip cutscenes or dialogue at all, ever, at least from what I've seen.

Every time I play a new one, I think “okay it can’t get any better than this.” Fast forward to completing games like RDR2, Dark Souls 3, hollow knight, breath of the wild, ori…every single one is downright amazing in its own way.  Next up buying my buddies PS4 and catching up on those exclusives like God of War, Horizon, Bloodborne, and the Last of Us. I expect to be dumbfounded a few times more."

They co-directed the first John Wick (actually IMDB is now saying Leitch is “uncredited” as co-director, but I’d always heard they did it together — he’s since gone on to do the **excellent** spy/action thriller Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2, while Stahelski directed all three John Wick films.  \n\nThe point being, they have a [stunt company together called 87eleven](https://www.87eleven.net/vision/), that has decades of experience between them.  And they’re making a name for themselves — I think they were called to touch up the action in Birds of Prey for example, and they were the best parts of the movie.  The scenes with the dogs in John Wick 3 are **top notch** and require so much planning and coordination to pull off.\n\nFor Ghost of Tsushima, I hope that they have one of the cinematographers from the John Wick franchise come back to film it.  Jonathan Sela did the first one (and Atomic Blonde, Limitless, Transformers: Last Knight, Deadpool 2) and Dan Lauststen did the second two John Wick films (and Brotherhood of the Wolf, Crimson Peak, and The Shape of Water).  I realize I’m geeking out about cinematographers here, but we all know the ***look*** of this game is everything and bringing back either of them is a vote of confidence in my book.  The stunts are a done deal.  We just need a capable script and talented actors, and I think we’re on the right path."

Just because something was easy to turn off for HD2 doesn’t mean it’s the case for a different game. Somethings take more than a few days to implement and test. Sony wants your money more than your PSN account they also don’t want to get sued for false advertising. \n\nThey should have foreseen this before launching multiplayer games in so many regions but that goes to show what people have said, they really are that lax with the PSN region thing."

The world is visually stunning, and the combat starts off slow but develops into something fascinating.

You are granted a number of ghost tricks, such as throwing knives or explosives.  And at times these are absolutely essential in combat, especially when you reach the second part of the island and the difficulty jumps up.  \n\nI didn't finish it, but I really enjoyed the 80 or so hours I played.

Yes its not the exact estimate. But as you can see the big difference in numbers of people getting achievements.\n\nJust by basing it on Tsushima since they are claiming most people who owns Tsushima bought this. Ratio wise its around 440K sold copies.\n\nThats why they cannot even release something like SOLD 500K COPIES. Yet theres a ton of shills already claiming it sold past 1 million because of some random tweet. Hahaha."

What will give GoT a slight edge in theory is that Sony are relatively more dedicated to polish. Sony would never ship a raging trash fire like AC3 Remastered. They just wouldn't allow it. You had stuff like Days Gone having rough launches, but that was a one-off. Also, Sony don't have the internal politics that have plagued Ubisoft for the past decade or so. General storytelling quality in Ubisoft games has (arguably) gotten worse through corporate mandate. And games have suffered mechanically due to corporate mandated structures/mechanics.\n\nBut like Horizon Zero Dawn, it is basically \"off brand Ubisoft\", and a lot of criticism and praise falls along similar lines. But Sony have way better quality control and that's reflected in the scores that approach 10/10. Odyssey's more glowing scores were in the low 90s generally. Also GoT has the pretty nice benefit of not featuring dubious microtransactions tied to the core progression systems."

      "text": "Quest went so hard and love that they gave us some closure on our boy jin. \n\nHeres all my thoughts: \n\nFirst, a minor nitpick I have is that the twin mountains of clan sakai aren't engraved on the blade when you equip it. I understand that's how swordkits have always worked in that they don't change the sword itself but how it looks. Makes sense they wouldn't want to change atsus main sword her dad made, but for the second katana it would be a nice detail, and easy to do since the sword is already modeled. Especially since the quest treats it as the physical sword. After all that, I want to have the actual sword, not just the ability to make my sword look like it. Anyway, this is very minor and easily ignored so I'm sure I'll get over it.\n\nSecond, Jin having a Shinobi den tucked away with a ton of armor and weapons makes me think he started training people and potentially is the reason groups like the nine tails exist. We know he's the first Shinobi but him training people in the art is distinct from people just hearing about it and attempting to copy him. \n\nThird, all the descriptions on the items are fire. The line \"he was a hero and friend to some, but a ghost to all\" gives me chills. And they tell us he fought in the second Mongol invasion years later. because of course he did. He's a true tryhard.\n\nFourth, I was never a fan of the idea of him and Yuna getting together and firmly belive it's OK for relationships to stop at friendship. I prefer that for them and don't think every story needs romance, which I liked about tsushima. That being said, jin has her dagger, and there appear to be children's drawings in the attic right next to it. \n\nI think that's enough evidence to assume they did get together and start a family, and if people want to believe that, then fine. However, there's also alot to the contrary. Jin appears to be buried by himself, and in his haiku he says he's alone. so I'm not sure if he had a family at all, it would just put them in danger after all. Yuna could have gave him her dagger as a keepsake, or maybe he took it off her dead body in the second invasion, anything could have happened. The drawings could have come from anyone too really. Maybe Jin just sucks at drawing. \n\nOf course, someone had to actually bury Jin, and taking everything I've mentioned so far into account, it makes the most sense to me that he was buried by his students. Hence, the single grave. \n\nR.i.p. the goat. This shit don't feel as good as it looks."

Also, just thinking about the very deliberate design choices the team made impresses me.  None of the extra side stuff on the map is worthless, it all has a purpose.  Every new outfit has its purpose to fit a certain gameplay style.  The amount of good cosmetics in the game is fantastic.  And none of them get outdated or outclassed.  There were some really cool cosmetics in AC Oddysey, but you could never really coordinate it well because they were always being outclassed by new gear.  I much prefer the system Ghost has, where you could very feasibly and logically decide to use early game armor for your entire playthrough.  The mechanic decisions across the board have been excellent.  I think the scale of the game is great as well.  The Witcher 3 was so big and had so much to do that it felt endless, which actually kind of encouraged me to just stop playing.  Ghost has a much more accessible scale, where I can feel satisfied that I have experienced everything.  Personal preference, I know, just something that I really liked."

It's a masterpiece for those who either don't play many games or are just so accustomed to typical open world games they'd be pleased by it. There is almost nothing unique to find in the open world at all. You can count the number of random encounters using your hand. There is one mission that really illustrates how lacking this game is. Early on you hear rumors of a haunted forest. The forest in question is lit in a spooky way and you have to find out why people are going missing there. Is it a ghost? Maybe rabid animal? A skilled killer? Nope. It's just another group of bad guys that are the same ones you fight throughout the entire game again and again and again. Also the stealth system is just a joke."

Ezo (modern Hokkaido) in the late 1270s to early 1300s was basically uncharted wilderness, the frontier and outside the rule of the Kamakura shogunate. It was populated mostly by the Ainu people and maybe a few small scattered Japanese settlements so it's the equivalent of someone who lived in the 13 Colonies of the US deciding to strike out into the deep west of the country in the 1760s and live a quiet life.\n\nEzo didn't become a part of Japan and it's government until 1869 during the Meiji Restoration where it was renamed to Hokkaido. In 1275 or later it would have been the ideal place for Jin to exile himself to while still being close to his homeland instead of Goryeo or China; it's outside of the shogun's authority and reach so he wouldn't be hunted for the rest of his days."

      "text": "I think it's awesome - Sucker Punch deserves the praise and success. A few of my thoughts:\n\nWhile it's not the most impressive in raw graphical fidelity (textures, models, animations), it might still be the most gorgeous open-world game I've played, especially in scenery and presentation. The colours, lighting, weather, foliage, geography, etc. There's such a range of tones, moods and visibility. Riding through fields of flowers at sunset (or in fog) looks incredible, and the blizzard of leaves in the vibrant forests is enchanting. \n\nThe gameplay is fun, smooth and offers a satisfying level of challenge (on Hard myself). There's just enough variety in tools and tactics to allow preferences in approach, though I wouldn't have minded a tiny bit more depth on that front, to the level of something like God of War with its many slottable attacks, but there's enough there. Combat is the tried and true mixture of sword clashing, guard breaks, parries and dodges. It has a \"Sekiro-lite\" feel, but more forgiving and loose. And the actual combat/kill animations are clean and understated, but still cool.\n\nI love the more naturalistic ways of guiding the player, with the wind and wildlife. I wish they'd gone further and toned down the info on the map even more to be honest, but the step they took to minimalise the UI and provide more immersive means of navigation is something other games absolutely should learn from. I also like getting side quests literally from random villagers as opposed to designated quest givers (as in, it seems to me like another player gets the same quests as me, but could get them from different people in different parts of the world). \n\nAs an open world, I like the activities and collectibles; finding vanity items is always appealing to me as a reward for exploring, and the Shinto shrine jumping puzzles are nicely designed. Maybe there could be a couple more different random events to stumble across, but for the most part the ones we have do the job.\n\nMy number one gripe (and seemingly other people's too) is for sure the camera and targetting. Maybe there's no lock-on because it would encourage SOME sort of UI highlight to indicate who you're targetting, which would go against their \"clean HUD\" approach, but I think a combat system like this begs that feature. Camera is absorbed by scenery a lot, and keeping yourself and your enemies visible on screen together is a pain sometimes. And yeah, you often swing for the wrong person because who you're targetting isn't clear-cut. \n\nOverall, very pleased though. It's not immaculate but it's super well crafted. And while I think TLOU is also a masterpiece, I'd be more than satisfied if Ghost got GOTY. In fact I almost hope it does purely because I think Sucker Punch deserves more recognition as a first-party. Naughty Dog and Santa Monica have had the pedestal for good reason, but I would say Sucker Punch has even been underrated until now. The inFamous games were fantastic - even Second Son, which I always thought went underappreciated, frankly."

But since it wasn’t Ubisoft everyone ate it up. I have tried to like the game but you are right, it gets very boring pretty quickly, and is very repetitive. Once I get to the second area and it’s just “go do all that again, but it’s more drab in this area” I fall off every time. You see all it has to offer in the first 6-8 hours then it’s just repeating over and over."

To me the game was buggy as hell and I still never got a grasp for the combat so I made a stabbing only build to compensate, but combat was still difficult and extremely deadly and ended up being what I liked about the game eventually. Despite looking like a Skyrim clone the combat is more like Dark Souls and without a plan you will die very quickly which makes even random encounters keep you on your toes. I agree the survival mechanics are annoying in the beginning but become trivial once you get to the point of having a “home” and some talents that compensate. As with most open world games, there are a lot of “sandbox” elements where you make your own fun and for me that was being a burglar and KCD has a unique system for calculating stealth and even if you don’t get caught, towns will get suspicious of the new guy when things go missing forcing you to move on and lay low for the heat to die down. The truth is the game is amazing but just takes way too long to get cooking (I would say 30 hrs) and is extremely punishing in the beginning especially with the lack of fast travel. It’s hardcore not for everyone, but extremely rewarding."

But Shadows, and a lot of the older AC games have much better stealth imo. Even AC1, with it's social stealth aspect, has better stealth than GoT.\n\nThat's not to say that GoT is worse than these games, I do certainly think it is better than most AC games. The only games that come close to GoT for me in the AC franchise are Black Flag (still obsessed with the naval combat), and Origins (Bayek is just incredible). GoT is one of my favorite games of all time, but as a person who until a few months ago primarily played stealth games, I felt it was lacking in that particular department. Everything else, I loved it."

I think they know that if they can just hit the right tone with it then it's going to be a huge hit. Pretty much everyone loves fun action adventure movies.

It's definite superior to AC games in this category.\n\n- The levelling system is well made and progression is seamless. It allows the combats to remain enjoyable until the end. \n\n- The map is mostly gorgeous and the game used the power of the PS4 wisely. While the textures are not great, the particle effects and vegetation are, making for a very atmospheric game. Seeing autumn leaves of momijis flying everywhere is magical. \n\n- The stealth system is pretty good. Much better than anything AC games have offered for ages. The Ghost is actually a ghost for once. \n\nBut there are also aspects that prevents me from saying it's a masterpiece. It's not even close to one because:\n\n- The northern part of the map, i.e., the last one, doesn't look great. Because it's snowy, the devs couldn't use the lush vegetation that efficiently hides the technical limitation down south. So this part of the island looks barren and a bit boring. \n\n- Collectibles and very basic activities everywhere. Exploration is not great because they didn't go beyond what AC games offer. Icons everywhere, indicating the same activity over and over. It gets very repetitive very fast.\n\n- The story and characters are very generic. There's no risk taking in this department. It results in often boring characters and events I just didn't care about. It doesn't help that the actor voicing the MC sounds bored most of the time. I found it almost insulting that the devs included a \"Kurosawa mode\".\n\nOverall, it's a good video game, but I'll never play it a second time."

Mental health is typically treated dismissively, so if you are ASD then dont expect them to be terribly understanding. Being different is also typically treated with caution, so individuality can be stifled. \n\nSome people still believe Japan is some techno advanced society with the latest tech, nope. Many still use fax machines, just for example. Adopting new tech is slower there in many ways, if I had to guess its probably got something to do with the stubborn old folk running things poorly while out of touch with the world the young face. \n\nThey very much have their narcissistic boomers there who think they had it hardest and the young are lazy and undeserving. Same shit, different culture. Politicians also pretty much exclusively cater to the old so legislation for young peoples issues are not a priority. \n\nI grew up fascinated with Japan and its history and culture.

      "text": "Most AC games haven't been like this. They are much more focused with their story and gameplay until recent years. Origins was open world but it had a relatively small world that made the open world bits not feel overwhelming and numerous, and it benefitted from it. Odyssey was much bigger in scale, but was just an excellently executed game, and personally in a setting I find fascinating and beautiful, so it was fun all the way through.\n\nWith Valhalla I had the opposite feeling - it was a setting I didn't care about, and they had also bloated the game significantly from the sounds of it. I never even tried it. I have been told Shadows is more similar to Origins than the other games in terms of scale and that it really helps the game, but haven't played it myself.\n\nGhost of Tsushima not only does the open world faff bits worse, but it also was sold like it's The Next Sony Summer Blockbuster when the story and characters aren't particularly interesting. It's more similar to Days Gone in terms of what Sony was trying to do with the game, except I hate Days Gone so I don't want to lump it in with that. Ghost of Tsushima isn't bad, it just gets really boring. It's Sony trying to do their ripoff of Assassin's Creed in the setting that AC fans were begging for for years, except they didn't do it as well.\n\nPeople shit on the Assassin's Creed games a lot, but honestly if you ask me it's one of the most consistently good long-running franchises out there. Like I said I haven't played Valhalla or Shadows, but I plan on playing the latter and the former seems like a solid game to me, just not my cup of tea and it's too long to bother... but I've played every other entry except Rogue, and there is not a single one I'd call bad or even mediocre.

I just completed one of the Mythic quests (follow the hints from a musician's tale to find a long-dead samurai's armor) and I really feel it would've been better to say \"In such-and-such province there is a hill with a crown of pink flowers which contains a hint of his final resting place\" rather than marking that hill on my map, having the wind blow me directly to it, then again marking my map with the exact location of the final confrontation for the armor.\n\nI'd have found those places pretty easily without precisely marking them on my map and it would've been more satisfying. Games should be more comfortable dropping clean hints and knowing players will be able to puzzle them out. Especially in a quest built around hunting secret treasure."

It’s just that this game takes place in the 13th century, and steel was much more effective in almost every aspect. Thus, the gold/brass in GoT is more likely just for cool aesthetic purposes:)"

No this is very unlikely to have anything to do with western nuisance streamers, and more to do with South Korean ultranationalists, who have been previously banned from other shrines on Tsushima island. \n\nSouth Koreans make up the vast majority of tourists to this island, for it is only a very short ferry away from Busan. And this island has a long history as a crucial trade hub between Japan and Korea/China, being crucial for the island’s economy and that of the local Soh clan. For a good reason, unlike that of Ghost of Tsushima, there are no sweeping plains and very little agriculture, this is a rocky heavily wooded mountain, the economy was based off fishing, trading, and occasional piracy. \n\nAnd so the island was the beneficiary of trade and plunder, and a lot of cultural artifacts from Korea made its way to Tsushima over the two Hideyoshi invasions and the long Japanese colonial period. A decade ago a bronze statue was stolen back to Korea, and since then ultranats have been looking for opportunities to take more."

I don't know why, but in general during last two years games have been called masterpieces more so than any other time and you can verify this through a lot of YouTubers calling a certain game \"masterpiece in narrative\", \"world building\" and more. \n\nPersonally though, i dont think got is a masterpiece at all. I thought samurai boy's personality was as thing as paper. If the characters, such as the revenge lady and the island of tsushima weren't there, i would have put the game down. Also, i really loved the combat, but my gawd, having the delay/latency at release leaves a lot to be desired. But otherwise, i really liked the gameplay and moee, so much so that i thought it was as good as sekiro's.\n\nThe reason i think got waa so highly regarded was because of the setting (samurai + Japan +beautiful setting). It was well hyped, and in all honesty, i still think tlou 2 played a part in it, only because i hated the fact i preordered a game that really had so much hate on both sides that made me realize that pre-ordering is a death sentence, even if the studio is naughty dog. To top if off, the year of covid was like shit and not much was coming out, so in general, got was a bresth of fresh air and lets be honest, some people called cyberpunk a masterpiece as well, before and post launch, so that's a testament to what a \"masterpiece\" is."

I'm more of a Ninja than a Samurai when it comes to preference and it definitely shows with the way I [play](https://youtu.be/YWVZRqIK1QI?si=jwTQ-7TRvUydXoOw) and customize Atsu, but because of how Naoe feels from a gameplay perspective and the freedom to customize her gear and moveset to my style (fast and acrobatic), AC Shadows will always be the slightly better game for me.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4u20knnnntf1.jpeg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4da626d5fa784e52806ce700fcb92df93977e34e"

I'd say 9/10.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat I think caught a lot of people is the \"arty\" style of the game. By that I mean that I consider some games to be pieces of art, and GoT is one of them. It looks wonderful, animations flow seamlessly, soundtrack matches it, combat flows extremely smoothly, interacting with the world is great. It's easy to see a beautiful game and call it a masterpiece, and even easier to make that judgement based on screenshots alone.\n\n  \n\n\nIt's obviously not a perfect game and has a few flaws. The biggest to me (and most often cited amongst my friends) is repetitiveness: find a camp, kill the guys, move on. Personally I found the different objectives just varied enough and the combat more than engaging enough that I was happy to overlook it, but it is a valid criticism and shows the game isn't perfect.\n\n  \n\n\nOn the other hand, does a game need to be perfect to be a masterpiece? I don't really think so."

The PSN is not available in my country and Playstation console players here can easily make an Singapore or Hongkong account. I think the problem for people like me who plays from steam in a PSN-less country. Since my Steam is from the Ph and my PSN acct is SG they won't link it (tried it from day one in helldivers 2) and I can't be bothered to use VPN because I can't afford Singaporean prices."

If you're not the first to market or Disney with 60% of the market locked down, you're going to fail.\n\nthe difference is that in gaming you can still get access to the content by purchasing it instead of a subscription being the only option. subscribing to 6 different services (where you can't even check what's on them before doing so) sucks, but for game launchers? other than some difference in features it doesn't matter much. game X will launch at the same price in its launcher as well as others, and with sales over time will also likely reach its same lowest price. So you pay the same and get the same, it's just where you do it that's a bit different.  \n\nlike, people still bought blizzard games when they weren't on steam."

Unless I'm missing something, I haven't seen any armor in Yotei that actually increases your melee damage, and I don't think I've seen any charms either. If you had no buffs in Tsushima, not every enemy died right away on Lethal, especially late game. \n\nPersonally, I think Yotei is leaning to a different style of play than Tsushima and I'm not relying as much on melee combat. I'm wearing the 9 Tails armor, which provides a damage buff to quickfire weapons. I'm wearing the kunai charm that allows you to throw 4 kunai that set enemies on fire. I'm using the charm that increases damage of quickfire weapons, and the major charm that increases fire damage. My kunai, Oni's flame, and blast bombs, all do major damage like this. You can one shot enemies with the kunai alone (not everything, but one tap after the kunai if they don't die). The armor also buffs stealth a bit, I'm having no issues tearing through camps by assassinating a few enemies, then exploiting all of my quickfire weapons. Charm of True Aim (I think it's called this) that lets you auto target 3 headshots with the Yumi bow is also insanely overpowerd. You can easily wipe out an entire camp in Yotei with a ranged setup, it's crazy strong just like it was in Tsushima.\n\nBosses/duels are another discussion. 🤣"

I treat DLC as something extra that I will only get if I *really* loved a game and just want more of it. \n\nI also think mid-game DLC can ruin the game's pacing in some cases. When I played LA Noire on PC I didn't realize until finishing the game that it included several DLC cases that were basically integrated into the main game. In hindsight I really wish I had known that and skipped those cases because one of my biggest criticisms was that the game's pacing was really bad.

They seem to forget that some of the biggest PC games (all of Blizzard games, Call of Duty, Fortnite, Apex, Minecraft, GTA 5, League of Legends, Roblox, Valorant...) have not been on Steam for a long time and still aren't for many. And all of those games also require another account even if they are on Steam by the way (which is actually the only thing going on with Helldivers)\n\nNot being on Steam has never been a big problem for games. Requiring another account neither (in fact I can't think of one major MP game that does not require that even if they are on Steam).\n\nThat sort of brand mentality to Steam is also very bad IMO. I like Steam a lot but it's a store/company that just want your money (you can only look to their games to see the same scummy practices than Reddit-hated EA or Activision are doing but that's fine there apparently), it shouldn't have some sort of cult following. It's as bad (even worse actually) than console warriors."

Compared to BotW for example where the whole game is playable in any order so it feels like there is no story progression until literally the final boss. Or AC Shadows, which does a similar thing as Yotei but the non-linear portion of the game is so much longer than the linear parts that it just feels like a bunch of disconnected stories rather than chapters in a single story. \n\nYotei feels like the best of both worlds. There are parts that can be played in any order so it really does feel like you the player are hunting and following leads organically. But enough of the game is linear to allow for the game to still feel like one engaging story."

That developer had worked there for 10 years and the only people who were mad about that were the same people that already weren't going to play the game because Erika Ishii plays the main character, so them deciding to cater to those people really rubs me the wrong way which sucks because i was quite interested in the game and love Erika but i'm just not sure if i can support a studio that did try to cater to the bigots. Additionally Erika has always positioned themself as radical so if the game didn't revolve around them I wouldn't put it past the company to have fired them too. The whole gaming industry feels too scared to actually stand up against these bigots, Ubisoft just cancelled an Assassin's Creed game about a former slave killing kkk members because of the backlash against Yasuke in Shadows and I am worried about Sucker Punch going down that same path.\n\ntldr: bigots mad that the game is too \"woke\" meanwhile i'm mad that the studio isn't woke enough\n\nEDIT: one last thing about supporting the game because it's good and it shows the industry that we want diversity: I bought AC Shadows and loved it but that didn't stop Ubisoft. Not to mention Microsoft and others shutting down their award winning studios, I'm not even sure if supporting a product does anything anymore"

I looked over there and it said it required an EA App account, etc. That info has always been there for every game released that has any additional requirements, DRM, and other specific info.\n\nShould it be bigger? I guess you could argue that, but nobody has ever argued about it before for other games that I've seen. Why would you increase the visibility of something that's not been an issue for people in the past?  \n\n\nLook at other games that have required other launchers to be installed, etc. How did people know about that before even buying the game? It's because that info, like DRM and Account requirements, is on the right side. So it's obvious that people see it and read it, so if that's the case then why would anyone make it bigger if it's working?  \n\n\nI think the main issue here is that the requirement was there, but wasn't enforced initially due to technical issues (these issues were also publicly made available, as was the information that the requirement was temporarily not enforced. so even if you didn't notice that right side of the game store, they also made posts about it in the past).

Even if they release numbers of  any sort, they'll spin them (like a certain company did recently talking about how many people were \"engaged\" with the game).  This will fuel both sides arguing.  You'll see people claiming it failed.  You'll see people claiming it has sold more than the first.  News reports claiming it's a massive success, touting paid shills giving high reviews.\n\nUltimately we're going to need to wait to accumulate numbers.  Unless it succeeds massively, in which case they'll advertise the numbers far and wide to 'own the chuds'.  Of course, if they don't advertise the numbers it doesn't mean that it failed massively either.\n\nIt's ultimately just guessing until the game numbers are forced out by investor calls, other company calls/press statements, or something similar.  Even then, companies like Ubisoft and EA have shown a willingness to attempt to hide actual numbers even when legally required to give them.  If they go private (\"if\"....lol, EA already has done, Ubisoft may follow) then the numbers reporting becomes even murkier.\n\nI understand the need to see want to celebrate the game failing.  I do.  Ultimately though you're going to have to take solace for a long while in your own decision to buy it or not, to point out what you might see as woke or worthy or not.  Maybe not the answer you want but trying to explain why you're likely to be disappointed in asking for concrete numbers unless the game turns out to be an absolutely massive, undeniable success story.\n\nPersonally I hope it fails.  Badly.  If only to repudiate a studio that put out Woke rubbish changes on purpose for no reason other than to push an ideology, and did things like hire developers who celebrated a man's murder.  But others may have a different opinion.  What you CAN take comfort in is that at least the numbers are known by the people in charge.  Hopefully if the game is a failure, heads will roll.  Perhaps a vain hope given how the Woke tend to fail upwards and avoid consequences, but a hope I have nonetheless."

I would get excited when I saw the Fox dens, since it meant there was a chance I could pet one.(love giving animals scritches in games lolol) The stoic character felt authentic to the the type of old school Samurai movies they were seemingly inspired from. The game sure had several of the open world tropes that studios are apparently tied to these days, but I guess that bothers me less than others, since I just seem to ok with kind of stuff in general for some reason. I was constantly finding the house banners in all sorts of weird places, but I can see how that wouldnt necessarily be fun, if what you want to do is explore and get something worthwhile out of it.\n\nIt sucks that everyone didnt love it as much as me, but then again, I dont like so many things others love.

Someone that gets most of their enjoyment from exploring the open world will like those games. \n\nMeanwhile games like Assassins Creed Valhalla and Ghost of Tsushima have largely the same enemies, items and quests spread across the entire world. Gamers that like exploring get burned out because you travel to a new region and find more of the same. \n\nIt is sadly difficult to tell what kind of game you get without spoiling it.

Compared to assassins creed, or hell, even better games than AC like Horizon or GoT, the open world stuff in rebirth is very very little. \n\nSo I’m just confused as to why people treat it like it has as much repeated content as a Ubisoft game"

I think the desire to complete it would have rested solely on the shoulders of the variety of side quests, and narrative, and I just didn't feel pulled in by either.

Still kinda wanting a hook to get into Days Gone too. (This might be a sign).\n\n\\- **Death Stranding**. It has an online component but it's 100% playable offline. Some might consider it convoluted but still has a great story. Some call it a walking simulator but most haven't played more then a couple or few hours or left the \"tutorial map\". It's worth. (I **emphasize** this just because some dude below is butthurt someone would like it 🤣)\n\n\\- **Star Wars: Jedi Survivor**. You played Fallen Order. Speaks for itself.\n\n\\- **Metal Gear Solid Delta**. I'd advise the Master collection but modern controls without the hassle of modding and  better graphics might be more accessible. Very replayable, lot's of \"hidden\" little mechanics to explore. Suggestion goes without saying if you like stealth/espionage the least bit.\n\n\\- **Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain.** Open areas tactical espionage sandbox. Also has an online component but it absolutely does not matter if you play offline. Also I'm fairly sure the gameplay inspired the start of remaking MGS Delta.\n\n\\- **Hollow Knight and/or Silksong**. If you're the least into metroidvanias or don't mind exploring a more \"indie genre\". I wasn't until I played both Ori games back to back. I'm still picky with the genre but I can appreciate the indisputably good ones now. A lot of hours to be put into these. Ori is notably less difficult than Hollow Knight games and I also recommend both **Ori games (Blind Forest and Will of the Wisps)**.\n\n\\- **Hell Is Us**. Worth checking out, gave me a few interesting hours until MGS Delta came out. Then I kinda forgot about it and it's still in my backlog waiting for me to continue. I advise this one based on your loose souls like experience with Elden Ring (I have no souls like experience. Played 10/15 hours of Elden Ring. Love watching gameplay, too impatient to play 'em.)\n\n\\- **Hitman: World of Assassination**. Hitman has no right looking as good as it does these days. Everything was remade in updated graphics. Hella fun espionage sandbox. Can't advise this one enough. Fitgirl version comes with a lot of unlocked content. Very worth the time investment.\n\n\\- **Space Marine 2**. For the campaign. Well crafted. Cemented my already existing addiction to Warhammer 40k lore in general.\n\n\\- **Metro 2033 and Last Light (Redux** version of course). Because you played Exodus. I'm fairly certain Fitgirl has a repack with both of them. Gameplay is still pretty good and they don't differ from Exodus that much apart from the open world bit.\n\n\\- Then you have gorgeous shorter games like **ABZÚ, Journey** (not sure if on FitGirl), **Sword of the Sea** and **The Pathless.** All very good chill games."

The fact that its been rarely reprinted (FTV, Invocation, and Masters 25 are the only real printings of it in the last 20 years) and its still less than $20, suggests there's just not much demand for it. By comparison, Demonic Tutor was in Commander Masters, Strixhaven Archive, Ultimate Masters, a Duel Deck, and was on the List a couple of times in the same time period - and is $50+."

The first 3-5 hours is the same experience throughout the rest of the game.\n\nIt's literally just about collecting collectibles, there's like 400-500 of them?\n\nI did find the environments cool and pretty as a first time experience, then you notice there's like only 3 different types and you keep encountering them over and over again; so there's so much they can do to keep that aspect of the game interesting.\n\nCharacters aren't memorable, and their persona's are bland and conflicting regarding their opinions and behavior, they're literally all hypocrites. Choices do not matter whatsoever. Sidequests were the same and kind of boring.\n\nGame got advertised wether you'd be a honourable samurai or a ghost/shinobi (and that's 'bad') and make it seem like the choice of choosing either one (which is basically shouting to duel or stealth killing) is an illusion as the story makes it canon that you decided to stealth/ghost/being 'bad'.\n\nThere are four enemy types, the same ones, but the way they indicate they are tougher is because they have different colour clothings. -- You then unlock 'stances' that would benefit/proper way to deal with each type, but by the time you've unlocked the 4th one, you already completed like 30% of the game and encountered all 4 times plenty of times before.\n\nSpeaking of duels, it's literally just assassinating half a generic camp, press the shout button and then you get a QTE that exists of the same button and by pressing this you can kill off the people one by one with ease. -- The same applies for enemies out in the wilds, outside these settlements/camps. -- It's a patrol you can always shout at for a duel and doing the QTE just wipes them out like it's nothing.\n\nThe world is static as hell, NPCs are bland and uninteresting, standing in place, providing nothing regarding lore or any form of (environmental) interaction. Shops are kinda meaningless.\n\nThe only positive are the unique duels/boss fights, I think like 10 of them (they're a form of collectible) that actually utilizes your skills and not making it a generic hack and slash/QTE game.\n\nThen besides that the only ''activity'' you can do in the world is just collecting collectibles. Nothing else.\n\nAlso another positive is the fact that the Multiplayer is far superior on every possible aspect;\n\nUnique roles that play different from each other. Then there is a far deeper customization where each piece of equipment unlocks or alters entire skills and changing the gameplay/role even further. Then there's rarity to them, upgrading, etc.\n\nDifferent gamemodes, PvP, PvE, short stories that are far more memorable along with a way better narrative. The gear looks different enough and some gear looks dope as Hell with the whole demonic/Oni aspect to them.\n\nEdit: Regarding the SP, stealth is so watered down/simple/broken. Which makes the forced stealth missions even more of a pain in the ass and also showing u the illusion of having a choice."

I think it's unlikely for us to see a Sony game with platinum aimed at < 10% players, rather than what we have now - usually way above 20%. I get that it makes sense from a financial PoV to allow a lot of people a chance to buy the merch, but it also devalues the exclusive aspect of it.\n\nedit: I thought fuck it, I'll get one. €11.35 for shipping? Are you kidding me? That's the shipping I would pay for a gaming console or a speaker, not for a tiny box. And it's not even a priority... I can pay €3.99 for shipping of that class, and that's already generous, considering the cost of making the item is probably like €2, and they are selling it for 15 times more.\n\nedit2: just checked my old orders, and Destiny badges were $20 and $8-10 shipping when ordering from the US.

I heard for KCD2 the animations are faster and smoother because it was annoying for all\n\nI do think all the things in this game to create realism will be a turn off for a lot, like having to get your clothes cleaned every once in a while or NPCs think you just got assaulted. But once you get the hang of all the small things it's pretty awesome\n\nGhost of tsushima I played it for a week because I had nothing to play, but found it repetitive very quickly and habe not touched it since. \n\nAlso, all RPGs are fetch simulators unless you get into the story lol. I really like the main story quests in KCD like having to investigate a raid, murder, finding clues, talking to villagers and being able to finish them in multiple ways   without much help, scouting enemy camps, sabotaging them before going back to the lord, giving him the info and choosing where to attack from"

Sure the amount of people who cared about Helldivers 1 on ps4 wasn't even close to the people who care about Helldivers 2 on ps5 but still nearly 50% of games published and owned by Sony on PS4 were indie-size games. \n\nThat's why games like Astro Bot, the rumored 2.5D God of War for next year, LEGO Horizon and even the fact that Sony now co-owns Sword of the Sea are important.

Sometimes it’s not even a choice, so value for money is rarely a concern.\n\nIt’s really hard to draw a line in the sand between postgame DLC and expansion that should have been a sequel. But more game is rarely a bad thing. I should say I prefer DLCs that don't make your character the protagonist of the story but merely a witness - say Control's AWE is more about Alan than Jesse and Hearts of Stone is just another witcher contract for Geralt. \n\nMy critique for some of those is that some of them - like Control’s Foundation or Witcher’s Blood and Wine - include a “true” ending for the characters in what’s essentially $20 pack of optional content an average player can totally miss. One negative example of that would be Horizon’s Burning Shores that basically has the first romantic relationship for Aloy that people can totally miss - that creates a question where her relationship with Seyka even starts in Horizon 3.\n\nDishonored DLCs will always take a special place in my heart - they show the world from a totally different perspective and iterate on gameplay masterfully."

Visuals, music, wind guide design, and many of the aesthetic trappings are top-notch. \n\nI think where most of the \"gamer\" crowd disagrees with the \"masterpiece\" label comes from the core open-world gameplay, which while solid is still derivative. At higher difficulty levels the game plays better because of the skill required, but I think many are tired of the wide but shallow generic stealth/archery/melee combat. \n\nOne of my bigger issues with the game, and why I still haven't 100% finished it, is my habit of doing all the side objectives possible before continuing the main story. I burned out pretty hard even though I was really enjoying the game. Knowing I have this habit, I could just play the game differently and focus on the main story, but it's a tough habit to break. \n\nOpen-world fatigue aside, I think the game is an excellent entry in that genre. It does about the best with that formula you can do. Is that worthy of calling it a \"masterpiece\"? Maybe. Regardless, I think OP's criticism relies too much on the supposition that others agree with him that it's overrated."

I was mesmerised by the graphics the gameplay and everything in between. The loading screens, the tapes, screeching sounds when loading a game. My spectrum is proudly displayed in my gaming room. Then I moved to a Commodore 64, SNES, Gameboy, PC 386 where I started playing Dune 2, Doom and Duke Nukem and all the fantastic games of the 90s. Then beginning of the 2000 I started owning most of the consoles. Today, because I can afford it, I own every piece of entertainment imaginable and hundreds of physical and digital games. Unfortunately, the older we get, the less time we have to play. I still manage to squeeze 2 to 3hrs per day with everything else I have to do. Just finished Batman Arkham Knight and put 81hrs to complete everything.\n\nThe PS5 is indeed a fantastic console. But for me the PS3 was the biggest leap in a generation in terms of graphics and gameplay (Motorstorm in motion on a 41” plasma TV was a sight to behold in 2006), then the PS4 sealed it with the generation with the best games imo and it is the generation where I had the most fun. The Pro was a great leap as well."

Apart from the question marks and symbols on the map there’s absolutely nothing to discover. The graphics look great at first glance but somehow they all feel the same. The only things that occasionally differ are the colors of the flowers and the trees. Otherwise the visuals also feel low in detail and polygons. The NPCs don’t react to the player in a believable way. They feel more like lifeless shells just standing around. Quests always follow the same pattern. You follow someone. Someone is dead. You follow the footprints and find the killer. No matter if you sleep for two nights in between or not the killer is always just behind the next hill. The stealth mechanics aren’t anything special either. Splinter Cell already did that better back in the day.\n\nThe main story is great and the combat is fun even though it gets repetitive after a while.\n\nAside from that the game basically just consists of ticking off the same icons and tasks on the map. Kind of soulless.\n\nBut if it’s someone’s very first video game ever I can understand the hype since there’s no point of comparison to other real and living open worlds."

By the time you're the Ghost and sweeping through enemy camps it's astonishing how immersive Jin's story feels. \n\nBut there are some elements in the open world that are definitely 2015-2016 coded in their design. Do as much or as little as you want. The joy of the game is mainly in progression and in the excellent story. The writing is so good here it makes me angry at times. It's not complicated but the themes are brilliantly spun all the way to the end. \n\nDo the Iki Island DLC before finishing Act 2 for additional narrative payoff."

Dishonored somewhat flashier but part of the reason I love it is because it has some of those older benchmarks like flowing semi-linear levels, campy storytelling, telegraphed guard patterns, etc. Those things are already showing their age and it hasn't even been that long. Crazy world!"

They're very different games, but both sort of came out at the same time and dominated online game circles for a while. TLOU2 is objectively the better game -- both technically, story-wise and graphically -- with more fluid gameplay and superior acting performances. It might not be everyone's cup of tea and some people might personally prefer GoT, but I find it baffling how people can call GoT the superior game. \n\nThe main critique I kept reading about TLOU2 were about the story and pacing, but I'll never understand how the shallow story and repetitive pacing of GoT could somehow be better? I understand that these things are subjective, but like, there's just no way. Some even called GoT the game of the year, which was especially mind-blowing considering Miles Morales, Half Life: Alyx and Hades also came out in 2020.\n\nI liked GoT at first, but wasn't able to finish it. I couldn't get over how lifeless everything felt: from the wooden acting to the robotic facial animations to the barren open world. Using the wind as a compass was fun, but felt like railroading to me -- there was absolutely nothing to explore besides the few places the wind pushed you towards. I don't know, maybe it's me though. I never understood the online love that Days Gone got either."

I loved the Arkham games a ton for the ability to make me feel like I was good without actually being super complex. It’s no dark souls for sure, but I am not the type of gamer who can engage with a game like that and have as much fun. The rock paper scissors combat let me feel like I was alright at games without being TOO easy.\n\nRight after this I played Jedi: Fallen Order and was let down by how clunky the controls felt. Ghost of Tsushima was smooth and the combat felt crisp. In contrast, Fallen Order felt bulky and I found myself frustrated feeling like I’d pressed block and it had been ignored by my enemy.\n\nOver all, one of my favorite games in a long time, but I can understand why people might like more of a challenge.

      "text": "I genuinely think this is part of the problem for this sub. While patient gaming is a great practice for getting games cheaply, one drawback is missing the boat on a community experience with the game.\n\nSome games that are a 7 or 8 out of 10 become a 9 or 10 based on hype alone, and on the community aspect. All the content that comes out of a game that is almost universally loved. But after that hype wears off (5 years post launch), you are left with a less exciting, more solo experience.\n\nThat being said, almost all the issues raised by OP were talked about on launch. I think one issue is that OP just doesn’t seem to like one of the most fun aspects of the game: clearing outposts, or in other words, the combat overall.\n\nThe combat to me was the game at its most fun. The story was good enough, the characters passable. But it was all an excuse to me to engage in the combat system.\n\nI played on the glass cannon mode, which to me sets it apart from most similar games. Initially, I tried to play stealthy to avoid death. But the game forces you into open combat quite frequently, so I had to learn strategies to survive that frankly felt exactly like guerrilla warfare. Dodging and weaving around trees, buildings. Constantly leading enemies on a chase, scrambling under houses to come out the other side, leaping onto platforms and rolling off before getting shot with an arrow, keeping my distance and fighting only when necessary.\n\nSee, most people think the game is trying to get you to play stealthily, but while it is an option, I think it is a mistake. The blend between stealth and open combat, the balance and shift back and forth is where the most fun lies.\n\nBut even this was often not an option. Face to face samurai combat happens often, and is gatekept by fairly difficult bosses in each area. This forced me to become great at the standard sword-fighting as well.\n\nSoon, I was the one on the hunt, no longer held back by slow reflexes and lack of knowledge. Now included in my strategy was charging head first into a group of enemies, cutting through them and powering through the other side, disappearing in a cloud of smoke before appearing again behind them to slice a path again.\n\nThe motion in this game is incredible. Like a tide coming in and out, I shifted between stealth and sword-fighting.\n\nPeople seemed to feel like they had to either choose between stealth or open combat, or they seemed dead set on choosing one or the other. I swapped between them gratuitously, and I feel it’s the best way to enjoy the combat. Use your tools, all of them. Throwing knives, bombs, arrows, sword.\n\nAnd this all brings me back to the thing OP hated the most: The outposts. The outposts did not feeling like a chore to me at all. In fact, I saw each one as an opportunity to experiment and test all the knowledge and tools I had gained. I found myself looking forward to smoke on the horizon, and not enjoying the more scripted story missions as much. \n\nI feel like OP missed out on part of what makes GoT special to me. \n\nOP, if you ever try it again, I highly recommend whatever they call the glass cannon mode if you haven’t already. Give it a go, skip all the cosmetic side content, and focus on perfecting the combat. It’s a blast. If you hate it, no worries. But that’s the way for me."

And it really depends how much you value these aspects.\n\nThe stealth is ok in GoT, level design of enemy camps is ok at best too, the side activities are pretty bad. So yes it does feel like it overstays it's welcome especially if you are me who does all the open world activities and doesn't use fast travel.\n\nBut I still find the story and characters more enjoyable than any recent AC game going as back as black flag I think the Voice acting(English) is really good throughout the game. The story is simple but has many beats that it hits hard.\n\nBut man the presentation of this game carries it so hard. Just the way the world looks and moves, the way wind guides your way, minimal UI, the way scenes are presented the way fights start with a stand off, each kill is so cinematic etc etc.\n\nSo yes while it's not the greatest of games I still enjoyed it more than any AC game again as back as black flag and I have played and enjoyed every AC game except shadows( which I will play in due time)\n\nI would say my expectations were just about met but I value the vibe of games a lot more than others maybe so that might play a part in that"

I think like 1/6 quests involves a male who is a healer monk type. This is feudal japan, even if the samurai died on the beach, and even if a caste of female nobles was privy to the use of weaponry, there's 0 percent chance that the leaders of these ultra violent cults all over the land would be errant females instead of the brutal warrior men who had spent generations training and being genetically selected for warlike abilities, culturally and politically endowed by their status and sex. It's absolutely bonkers to entertain even for a second. And it's super immersion breaking. The game is constantly inserting cringe monologues to talk about how strong and viscous the female fighters are, and often makes male characters humiliatingly defferent to them. \n\n  \nWreaks badly of sweet baby inc.-ism.

I know this sounds obvious but I got into such a habit of map clearing that playing action adventure games just became a \"job that needed doing\" (coughUBISOFTcough).\n\nI'd quite frequently just go straight past an optional thing like fox, bird, haiku location, side quest whatever just because I didn't feel like doing it. As for the crafting, I honestly don't remember purposefully going out of my way to craft anything.\n\nFor combat, again in a similar vein to the open world I just didn't rush it.

Not to mention collecting crickets, Sashimono banners (I guess you get a cosmetic saddle?), and Mongol records - I didn't see the point.\n* Of the useful things, we have mostly just bamboo strikes (no penalty for failure, as many tries as you want), fox dens (literally just follow a fox), and hot springs (press a button to think about...), which all give the same result throughout the game\n* Most of the alternative armors they gave were useless - I understand the reason for the archer armor, traveler's armor, and the ronin armor, but the samurai armor is superior in almost every circumstance. Who wants to go into the menu and change into it when you need to fight for real?\n* Give me a reason to go back to the survivor camps, enemy outposts, or liberated villages. After discovery there really is no point to go back.\n\nAnd some of the design decisions they made were pretty weird.\n\n* Just let me walk of off ledges instead of having to wiggle around until he drops down\n* Jin is going to free solo up and down sheer cliffs in full samurai gear? lol, no\n* Horse speed is either super fast or too slow - nothing in between. What if I just want to chill out and see the scenery at a reasonable pace?\n* Enemy AI is pretty bad/unrealistic\n* Zombie NPCs/static world\n\nI think they did a great job with the atmosphere, and the sword fighting was simple but satisfying. I thought the open world itself was well designed with interesting geography and cute villages. The duels are exciting and especially the mass battles - like Yarikawa - were really cool, as well as the one where you use the hwacha. My mouth dropped open when Jin becomes the Ghost - such a cool scene. Despite all of my complaints, it's still a fun game and worth playing IMHO if you're into the feudal Japanese theme."

I've trained with a few enemies and gotten the timings down to a T. \n\nBossfights though? I landed perfect parries semi-consistently, as in: I'm landing perfect parries often during the fight but struggle forcing them consciously.\n\nPersonally, I think the blue and red glint of unblockables is often too bright; covering the whole weapon and making it impossible to tell where the weapons are mid-swing, therefore making it hard to learn timings without a tell."

Atsu convinced him not to because the oni was more important, hes mad because he compromised himself by listening to atsu and now they have neither the prisoners nor the oni\n\nI think the weapons complaint is really silly. Atsu masters weapons in a day for the same reason you can make kratos, a man who can kill gods, die against random fodder enemies. This is still a video game which means video game mechanics have to be considered. Nobody wants to spend long amounts of time learning to use a new weapon.

Thematically being just a badass samurai with badass artwork will make him, and by extension his drop, far more palatable to those not fond of UB products that feel out of place in magic to them. \n\n\nI suspect he will end up quite expensive and that lair to sell very fast.

Most games at this point have the level of wind/cloth physics as this game so far has shown.\n\nSo far from the gameplay demo's of this game, its implementation is fairly basic and it looks faked.  For example, in this animation, the cape and grass are not behaving as if they're being acted on by the same wind force.  They seem to have some prebaked calculations to make it look like wind is happening.  Most people won't realize it as they play the game.  This game isn't doing anything amazing technically or in gameplay.  If you stop to look at it you'll also see some pretty low quality textures on the environment and some really bad draw distance level of detail drop off.  What it does have is a great art style to distract from the blemishes with some good use of color.    Will look great in HDR I'm sure."

I barely had any money to get more than a game or two per year.\n\nThe PS4 (Pro) was the machine that got me into more of a hardcore gaming lifestyle. I was all over basically every high profile PS4 exclusive. God of War? Spider-Man? Last of Us? Yes, please. Give me more.\n\nThe PS5 feels like a suped up PS4 in some ways because the leaps between consoles are getting to be more nuanced and less obvious. It's a solid console, and I've had a good time playing through big games like Ragnarok and now Yotei right at launch. At the same time though, I now have a powerful PC rig, so the PS5 doesn't blow me away so much as just feel like a solid complement to my gaming experience.\n\nThe PS4 is probably the machine that best encapsulated that feeling of PlayStation magic.

I never finished it because it was just boring, all lore/exposition rather than story from what I played, more about mood/atmosphere probably\n\nDishonored (first game): idfk, very forgettable or else I'd remember\n\nGhost of Tsushima - basic story, not particularly interesting, explores honour in war (consequentialism vs deontology), little to no mystery, mainly aesthetics with a side of story, still in my top 5\n\n*God of War* series - grand narratives, basic premises, themes of parenthood, grief/trauma, anger/restraint, cycle of hate, good to great mystery\n\nHollow Knight - good/great lore, as with dark souls series Hollow Knight only really has a story that you have to read (and i don't mean dialogue that you read), great mystery but not explicitly tied to \"narrative\", wouldn't recommend as a story game, but is in my top 10\n\n*Star Wars: Jedi* series - good stories, but uninteresting premises, themes of hope, fear, temptation, altruism vs self-preservation, trauma/grief; 1st game in top 10, decent mystery, 2nd in top 20, good mystery\n\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - main narrative decent, themes of nature vs nurture, rebellion vs self-preservation (consequentialism vs deontology); some side stories are decent; main character is central to prophecy and fate of the world but has no personality, making stories feel fantastical and distant; decent to great mystery\n\n*Tomb Raider* series - meh (honestly bad) stories, but very fun game world and combat, poor main story mystery, a bit better mystery when it comes to lore\n\n---\n\nOthers still:\n\n*Call of Duty* series: themes of war, necessity/consequentialism, trauma, mostly good mystery\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2: haven't played, but it looks like it'll have an actually great story\n\n---\n\nSo imo, there really is not much grand storytelling in gaming (yet?) as there is in other media."

It's not anything ridiculously complex, but that's fine. We don't need every single game to try to be The Last of Us or something. It tells a realistic grounded story with no bells or whistles.\n\nIt's what people wanted from the Assassin's creed series for a while, which is a mostly historically accurate open world fighting game. It feels \"tame\" because it took what made those games fun, and trimmed all the fat off so that just the fun stuff was left (for the most part).\n\nIt's not the best open world game of all time, but it accomplishes what it set out to do fine. The combat is fun, I was actively excited to go to the next area to fight. Normally in games like this, I always attempt stealth first, then switch to normal combat once I get discovered, but this game I actually wanted to go in and just fucking brawl with people because it felt awesome. I can't think of another open world game where I enjoyed fighting so much that I actively avoided stealth (even though the stealth was fine).\n\nThe encounters were well balanced, the enemies were not frustrating to deal with, you had to change things up just enough during fights to keep them from getting stale. \n\nIt's a good ass game. It's not RDR2, but it's good."

Other games I consider 'great average games' are games like Mad Max, Days Gone, Uncharted etc\n\nGameplay wise, the game doesn't do anything particularly special. Combat is relatively simple, but it's accessible without being too shallow. There is depth to be found. The approach you can take to combat is very varied and allows for a fair bit of variety in how you approach things. Do you sneak in and assassinate everyone? Do you just straight samurai everyone? Do you use ranged combat? Do you get in close quarters and use all your gadgets to give you the edge? It's very varied and I like it. I like engaging with all the different systems. (I also hate x-ray vision so I don't use it at all)\n\nThe scenery and setting is *beautiful*. Anyone who disagrees is, in my opinion, just being deliberately argumentative. I genuinely think it's undeniable. Ive lived in Japan and the way it captures so many different little bits of their culture and history in a respectful way is really impressive, and anecdotally I've heard that the Japanese liked it too. As a full blown gaijin I feel like it captured the mysticism and serenity of Japan as it is experienced by a westerner without being reductive or fetishistic.\n\nThe open world design is where it falls flat imo. Why, when you have foxes and birds and wind and all manner of other visual and audio cues to follow, would you litter the map with markers? Why?\n\nI would far rather have had a Yakuza style smaller open world and pick up side quest content by interacting with the world and the people.\n\nI found it also was too button mashy on normal. I wanted an experience that challenged me, required me to adhere to the samurai beats of punishing your enemy's mistakes, parrying, etc. I put it on the hardest difficulty where a few hits and you're dead and I found the combat much more rewarding, but dying wasn't unforgiving as you'd respawn outside the place you died and the checkpoints were generous. I played sekiro and I just couldn't get into it. I'm old and I've got a kid and I play games for fun and I just found it frustrating, and this gave me the samurai Japanese role playing experience I wanted.\n\nI never found the game to be dull, but I did find that I didn't want to pick it back up after a while. I never finished it, but I'm currently replaying it as I get maybe half an hour game time each night after the baby is asleep and it's the perfect game to drop in for half an hour every night."

There is no decline in artistic quality, only a decline in their ability to appreciate new things. As much as people say modern gaming sucks, probably over half my alltime top 10 games have come out in the last 10 years. Even in terms of sheer quantity, it's undeniable that there are way more games being released every year than there were 10 or 20 years ago. If you are finding you are not enjoying any new games you might need to broaden your horizons and try things you otherwise wouldn't.

I don't disagree with you on the nostalgia part, >!I was grinning from ear to ear when I found Jin's old gear, wore it for the rest of the game.!< However, nostalgia aside, compared to Tsushima, Yotei's ending was, to me, too fast, and also a little too predictable. To start,>! The Dragon and The Spider could have, and imo, should have had a longer hunt. I think the way both of their fates are settled is fine, but both characters could have had so much more in them character wise. Compared to the Oni and the Kitsune hunt, they both felt partially bland, and when your Saito's direct descendants, both with problems regarding with how your looked upon, it could've been built upon much, much more. !<\n\nSecondly, >!The wolf pack, and some side characters in general, is wasted potential, and wasted story. Aside from arguably 5 characters, what do the rest of them do for me after Chapter 1? What do they contribute to the plot? (Excluding Hanbe, tbf) I know most of them are just there to help upgrade gear, but in that case, why are they considered my wolf pack? I'd argue that Kojiro literally does more for me then the rest of them do, and he's not even IN the wolf pack. And on that note of wasted potential, there are MANY characters who appear, and then just disappear with no explanation. Commander Wada, for example. WTF even happened to him? He's calling the big shots for Clan Matsumae, and we don't even know if he's alive or dead? With roughly 20+ people in that wolf pack, way more could have been made possible with them for the main story. !<\n\nThirdly, to finish it off, >!The final battle was, to be honest, a little disappointing for me. And the reason for that, is because of how friggin forced Jubei's death was. Jubei dying isn't an issue for me, but the way they kill him off is just ridiculous. It felt like they we're trying to give me an extra reason to hate Saito, which I didn't need at all. He already hung my mother in front of me, as well as killed my father, and pinned me to a burning tree to die. HAD they killed off Jubei EARLIER, then fuck it im down to hate on him for that. But otherwise, his death was needless. It was the \"Taka\" death they couldn't figure out to put in somewhere, so they just threw it in there.!<\n\nOverall I really really enjoyed the game, but it's just not quite Tsushima on a storytelling perspective. Again, not a bad story. Better than Tsushima however? I would just have to say no."

In GOT, if it's not marked on the map, there's nothing there. And there are plenty of things marked on the map that are horribly boring and repetitive. One is chasing down foxes that lead you to shrines and give you some XP boost or something, another is sitting and contemplating the scenery in order to compose a haiku (although some might find this soothing).\n\nThat being said, most of the main quests and side missions are quite well-written and interesting. The gameplay is really fun and the story is awesome. And the art is absolutely beautiful. It's a great game.\n\nBut, by the end of it of the main story, I was definitely ready to be done with going to question marks on a map...which is pretty much how I feel with all Ubisoft games."

      "text": "Yeah, but they likely want those hundreds of thousands of player's data to sell. I don't think Ghost of Tsushima will quite reach Helldivers 2 player numbers. It's still very, very anticipated. But even then I reckon a good amount of players will wait for sales like they did with Horizon 1 and 2. Helldivers 2 has 10x the players of Forbidden West. So we can say it'll maybe have 4x the players of Ghost of Tsushima. That's a lot more data to sell. Especially since it'll hold those numbers longer than a singleplayer game would. \n\nThey are doing this purely to make money off the insane number of Helldivers players and their data. That'll also stay loyal to the game for potentially years. It'll be interesting to see just how many people actually leave the game, on top of the players they've forced out cause they live in countries where they can't make accounts. There are a few of us on reddit already pushing Steam to refund us, and some with success. Sony really fucked over Arrowhead. I have my problem with their balance decisions and the time it takes to fix bugs, but the game was genuinely fun. Sad times."

There’s also lots of people frustrated thinking that they removed the detective vision for stealth, when actually it’s just locked behind progressing the Kitsune quest, and some people(like me) left that one for last. \n\nThere were also people thinking the game was pulling a Breath of the Wild with having that Saito quest appear so early in the first region, like with BotW where you could go fight the final boss right away with no upgrades.\n\nThere’s an obvious linear progression in the game, but the devs don’t make it clear for you.

Nothing drives me more nuts then reading reviews that pan a game because it's somehow different from it's e3 showing, or something similar. Now if it was a batman game in press releases, and animal crossing in release, great pan away. But my example is usually Watchdogs. It was a decent open world GTA alike that had a fairly forgettable story and some interesting & unique mechanics that added up to a pretty ok game that scratched my itch waiting for gta5 to hit PC. I snagged it on sale for like 25 bucks, and enjoyed the hell outof it. Go look at reviews for it and they spend a substantial amount of the article crying about how it looks different than the e3 showing. Well I never watched the e3 propaganda that year so all of these things were news to me, and frankly, none of those gripes were relevant as trade show previews are notorious for being rushed out and not entirely representative of the game being shown. I remember the killzone fiasco. Oh and half the complaints were about level of graphics, which was way more of an issue on console anyway, and not on the PC, despite the pc release being given a literal copy paste of the console review.\n\nNot only will you enjoy games more once you stop consuming this kind of news, it'll also become easier to not buy games at release for 60/80+ dollars (season passes), and instead pick up the GotY version a year later on sale for like $15, complete with all of it's major bugs ironed out etc."

I rarely get bored, but I've noticed that there isn't much variety to the missions. I find myself ocasionally feeling like it's a chore now, because I'm trying to find the last camps to free the first region and I'm just riding around encountering small groups of mongols to fight and NPCs I can't interact with. Still haven't found out how to free the region completely.\n\nI think you're on point on the \"very beautiful but empty world\". I still like traversing it, but the NPCs are very generic, the dialogues are really basic outside of main cutscenes and there aren't easter eggs or vastly different environments to interact with (only to look at). That said, the beauty of the landscapes and the little things like finding swords in Altars of Honor and the straw hat duels help me engage. I expected a little more but overall am satisfied and having fun."

Twiddling so many settings, modding, emulating and the benefits of things like dual monitor set ups. It was truly magical in a way. \n\nFlash forward 5 years later, I just want to play the PS5. I dont like being confined to a desk, im tired of bad PC ports. I feel like I never know if a game is gonna run smooth or not and honestly I hate fiddling with 20 different settings to find the right balance between performance and visual fidelity im happy with, much prefer just two flat modes PlayStation games have. Even then, you never know if a PC game is just gonna run like shit anyway because it just isn't optimized at all. And generally speaking PCs just can experience so many more hardware and software issues. And it can be the littlest thing that is SO hard to pin down and I hate digging for it. \n\nYes you can hook up your PC to a TV but when I bought a lengthier HDMI cable for the sole purpose of doing that, the experience was not great. I found input delays I had never experienced otherwise on my TV, the same TV I do console gaming with mind you, as well performance issues that looked like weird frame pacing problems and I just gave up. Im sure with some digging maybe id find the settings to make it smoother, or maybe the HDMI cable I used just wasnt great for getting the PC to the TV, but again, im SO tired of messing with it. \n\nFor those with the patience, PC gaming is beautiful, but getting a PC in the long run, ironically made me appreciate console gaming more than i ever had.\n\nEdit: also I'm not sure about games being cheaper anymore, I unironically do not think Steam sales are more impressive than PlayStation sales anymore. It feels like the PS Store has a crazy sale every week now with tons of games. Nintendo though, awful game prices."

But the fact that the game immediately gets more respect, just tells you the AC fanbase is one of the worst ever. Shadows was really spot on, the game is arguably just as gorgeous, combat is fun, and stealth is pretty spot on, but as soon as AC fans realized they couldn't criticize that (or the game's incredible graphics) they went on to hyperfocus on other things like the story, the characters (more specially Yasuke) and even the animations. This literally proves they will never ever be happy, and fanbases are the difference here. Ghost of Yotei fans actually appreciate how artistic and similar the game is to Ghost of Tsushima because they loved that game too. And yet again, after watching hours of Yotei gameplay, (as great as the game is) you are correct in the fact that it is more of the same. Not to mention I've seen tons of animations from Yotei that leaves me thinking \"these are the games that are allegedly so superior to the AC games? Meh.\" The game can also feel pretty boring at times with the slow oriental music and the endless dialogue. Naoe looks better than Atsu, and yet even that fact is being turned against AC Shadows with people saying \"well, warriors don't look like that\" and bla, bla, bla. And let's not even talk about parkour and stealth, Shadows is lightyears ahead there.\n\nIs it still a wonderful game? Yes. Would I ever consider getting it? Also yes. But am I impressed?

I've grown to consider DLCs as an \"addition\" that I can decide to purchase after playing the main game, if I like it a lot and want to keep playing a while longer. This is not an approach that applies that well to mid-game DLCs set within a larger game's progression, which may even ask you to either replay the game itself or use a compromise with a pre-set save that I'm sure isn't considered the best way to enjoy said piece of new content. I don't particularly like the idea of being \"required\" to buy a \"complete\" edition before I even understand if I enjoy the base game, either, although I could just work around that by just considering the complete edition the \"base edition\".\n\nThere are also games that tend to mix both approaches, such as Horizon Zero Dawn: Frozen Wilds is completely separate from the main game in terms of story and doesn't contribute, but it still unlocks midway and, beside a recommended level warning, you can decide to play it as soon as you see it available or (like I did, as I bought it after finishing the main game) after finishing the game and reloading the save before the point of no return to get to the DLC area. I like that idea, personally, and in the case of HZD, it gave me a reason to fire up the game again a year after I finished the original story."

While the game/story is in many ways generic samurai fiction, it is depicting a real historical event that has cultural significance to Japan—it makes it particularly important they get this right and take authenticity seriously.\n\nI agree with Chad Stahelski that the entertainment landscape is now more open to subtitles/media in native languages.  This is one of the greatest things Netflix has done tbh.  But for such a major film I suspect having two language tracks will end up being a necessary reality.  \n\nI am very excited and encouraged for the film.

Yotei is excelling where Shadows is weak: \n\n\n- characters\n- story\n- cinematic storytelling\n- Rewarding exploration\n- less tedious mini games and POI\n- side quests\n\n\nI like the stealth gameplay of Shadows, and I want to enjoy it - but for me actually caring about characters and the world is important. I hope I will be able to try out the DLC in the future, but that will probably be after I've played hundreds of hours of Yotei and got some rest from the genre. But at that point, a dlc for Yotei might arrive. \n\n\nJust comparing the quest design is telling, in Shadows you stumble upon random targets and afterwards find a note lying around. In Yotei I found group in the woods obviously being terrified of something but pretending everything is fine. One person whispers to you that I should look at the bounty board if I want to know more and help them. If I do that, I get more information and returning to the area things will play out in a cinematic and satisfying way, while still avoiding the non-immersive spawn in after accepting a quest. Yotei does this all the time."

Interestingly, the video you linked (HAP3 to HAP4) still features the 2-beat walk animation (for the \"new\" version) which was actually fixed and turned into a correct four beat animation in the pack with that same update. \n\nI hope it's clear to you that I mean no ill will towards you or your work. I just really wish gamedevs had better options to choose from when it comes to correct horse anatomy. And who knows, maybe some additional awareness of these issues can help you prioritize another animation overhaul for HAP.  \n\nShould you decide to work on the HAP animations again and need an additional eye on it for feedback/input, you know where to reach me, I'm happy to take a look and give constructive pointers wherever possible!"

Unlike Dragon Age and Assassin's Creed which had multiple bad sequels before the latest slop, the \"Ghost\" IP hasn't burned out its welcome yet. \n\n\n-Normies aren't as in tune with the political/culture war stuff as dedicated games are. No matter how loud the discourse is online, it isn't necessarily a reflection of the entire world.\n\n\n-Big marketing push(?) and strong critic reviews. \n\n\nNow... there are also possible reasons why it WON'T sell well...\n\n\n-PS5. There's simply less owners of it than PS4. I don't know what the real number is of PS5 owners, because the thing was scalped to hell at launch. So many PS5 listings on eBay and such...\n\n\n-Normies might still be more aware than I think. After 15+ years of the \"progressive\" messaging in games, we've seen people are getting tired of it, and a mideous female lead is a telltale sign. The Charlie Kirk situation, and the thousands of firings over people being demons, has been quite the sign that people are tired of \"progressives\".\n\n\n-Strong critic reviews. I think more people distrust critics now than those that do trust them. Even if it's a good game (ignoring the obnoxious parts like the main character), no way it's a 10/10 like all the reviews say.\n\n\n-Sony's brand image might be damaged after bombs like Concord. \n\n\nSo yeah... I don't trust any numbers (official or not), but the outcome will be the telling truth. Will Sucker Punch make another \"Ghost\" game after this? Or will they have to start laying off people?"

And I had to buy LotSB by buying Bioware points.  And then the final game didn't really seem to take much cognisance of what should be a huge element of the end of that DLC, pertaining to one of the main characters - presumably because not everyone would know about it.  Although to be fair, that character's absence from ME2 was barely touched upon really.  Actually in fact that DLC did in some ways feel like it made a mysterious character, the Shadow Broker, less interesting in some ways.

It was technically inserted into the middle of the game (though near the end), but I played it after completing the game, and that was just about magical. The end of the game proper technically tells the end of the story of Shepard and the Normandy and its crew, but the Citadel DLC was a send-off to the beloved characters. I'm very glad I played them in that order.\n\nContrast this to Witcher 3, which doesn't frame its DLC as post-game, but treats them as such. Which was annoying, because I played them during the main campaign (because, given the choice, I'll always choose the quests that give me upgrades before ones that just advance the plot), and it kind of broke the game. Difficulty was all over the place, and the Blood and Wine DLC even has some dialogue that discussed how the main game ends (even though it hadn't \"happened\" yet)."

I always feel this way when developers get into a series; I even felt this way about Naughty Dog with Uncharted and TLOU. I love those series, but when you’re getting just one series for like 10 straight years it’s a bit disappointing. Especially with how many samurai games we have these days, I really hope Sucker Punch does something new with their next game."

Now, I have no idea if eastern civilisations did brass brushing, but that's an option.\nIt consists of brushing a brass wire wheel on hot steel plates to melt some of the brass that will civer the steel and make it basically plated"
