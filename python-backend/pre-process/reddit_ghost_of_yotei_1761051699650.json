The repetitive, checklist-style open world structure is still a factor in Yotei, but there's more variety to the tasks. Yes, Atsu will need to go visit a bunch of shrines to unlock new techniques and abilities, but the path to each one is unique. One might require climbing and platforming up a mountain, while another may involve light puzzle-solving or stealthily clearing out a group of enemies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what interests me the most since Tsushima was terrible in that regard. Looking forward to playing this when it inevitably drops on PC."

My workaround was to slowly walk at the edge of the pathway, that worked.

And with the exception of ED Libra, I usually felt 3 bar revives weren't worth it unless I had an ultimate that could do it automatically.\n\nIt was a wake-up call for many people I figure."

I was so put off by its reputation for difficulty—and its actual difficulty on playing it—that I nearly passed by all it had to offer. But I'm glad that I stuck with it long enough to figure out what I would have been missing otherwise. Sekiro is \"cinematic\" in ways that cutscene-driven games have only ever gestured towards. I'm still in shock that *this*—one of the hardest action games that I have ever even *tried* to play—uses *every* ounce of that difficulty for dramatic purposes; to tell a better story in a more novel way.\n\nSekiro is probably my favorite game of all time, even though I originally bounced off of it, but sticking with it was so, so worth it."

Yes its not the exact estimate. But as you can see the big difference in numbers of people getting achievements.\n\nJust by basing it on Tsushima since they are claiming most people who owns Tsushima bought this.

Every video game is not porn, and is not made specifically to make men who've never been within 10 feet of a woman they weren't related to get horny. Romance novels are literally... romance novels. Not to mention, this specious-ass fact from a random website about the average male height in fantasy novels being 6'3\" is a pretty far way away from \"every female character must have gag boobs and a face like a blowup doll because otherwise I won't play this game that's about [insert topic that is notably not pornography].\"\n\nAlso, you could link to the meme, you just can't link to posts on other subreddits without at least an NP link.

As both videogames themselves and the tools to make them became more mainstream and accessible, two things happened:\n\n* Games started to be perceived as a more meaningful artistic medium, so we started to see an increase in mainstream critical analysis of them. This included feminist critiques which challenged gamers to reflect and think critically about their own attitudes towards women. They did not like this.\n* There was an increase in the visibility of women and minorities in the industry, both because they were always there but previously pushed to the sidelines, and because diversity is just good business sense in a market economy.\n\nThis created a cultural backlash where men who were very protective of their identities as nerds and outsiders started to view the presence of other perspectives as an attempt to encroach upon their community. They feel an entitled sense of ownership over games as an artistic medium, and get very angry when that ownership is challenged by any attempt to appeal to an audience that isn't them.\n\nEach of these guys has their own internal criteria for what makes a particularly female character \"woke forced diversity\" or just a normal lady. Usually these criteria are nonsense or even mutually exclusive; they're operating off of an \"I know it when I see it\" mentality. But the upshot is that any female character in any game is going to violate at least some of these guys' criteria and trigger a wave of angry posting about how videogames are being ruined by the woke left or whatever.\n\n[Also it's Gamergate's fault.](https://youtu.be/lLYWHpgIoIw?si=-iGrwEQ1HhEHqIyd)"

Was very common late 90's and early 2000's before multi projects became the norm to see half a dev team fired after shipping.\n\nThat and if you're a single project studio and that project fails, it puts the entire company at risk pretty much immediately.\n\nOn the other hand... trouble is that in the current industry conditions, everyone is so aggressively avoiding investment and thinking in the short term only that it doesn't seem to be helping much to be multi project; failed projects are just seeing whole teams laid off instead of trying to absorb the impact and thinking about the long term benefit of retaining staff.

It does an excellent job utilising the open world activities to further the games overall aesthetic and tone, but by in large the activities boil down to clearing enemy bases, climbing puzzles, collectables and collectables you chase a short distance - stuff that Assassin's Creed was doing nearly 20 years ago.      \n\nThe weakness of Assassin's Creed open worlds is the sheer overwhelming amount of content, but that content has been iterated upon and experimented with across its many many entries by this point.

Honestly in comparison GoY is a AAA game on a AA budget which is amazing. Games shouldn't be costing $200m or more.\n\nThe reason why AAA games budgets are so inflated is because there's way too much emphasis on graphic fidelity, and spectacle. \n\nNotice how GoY is a beautiful game but not trying to be hyper realistic with everything. It's a game trying to be a game, not an interactive cutscene with 2000+ different animations the character can do to make it look like what they're doing is real. All that for a 25 hour game with barely any replay value because the budget went into making everything look good, instead of having anything to do in the game.\n\nYou can see where GoY and GoT \"cut corners\" with things because it doesn't waste your time trying to be anything more than a game. Some people expressed they didn't like these games cut to black for characters to do something SP obviously didn't make an animation or cutscene for, just get to the point.\n\nDo I need to see a character ready a boat to travel? No, cut to black I'm on a boat. Do I need to physically see someone hand Atsu an item or money? No, make an animation of giving something and be done with it.  Do I need to have a cutscene of character waiting for it to be night time? No, cut to black, it's night and time to go. Do I need to see an animation of Atsu preparing to do one action? No. The game respects your time, gives you context, and moves on and gives you control back. \n\nAlso, no 40 page script of characters talking while all we're doing is slowly walking/riding a horse, doing literally nothing else.\n\nGames USE to be like this more and didn't have all this inflated BS and padding in it."

Unless I'm missing something, I haven't seen any armor in Yotei that actually increases your melee damage, and I don't think I've seen any charms either. If you had no buffs in Tsushima, not every enemy died right away on Lethal, especially late game. \n\nPersonally, I think Yotei is leaning to a different style of play than Tsushima and I'm not relying as much on melee combat. I'm wearing the 9 Tails armor, which provides a damage buff to quickfire weapons. I'm wearing the kunai charm that allows you to throw 4 kunai that set enemies on fire. I'm using the charm that increases damage of quickfire weapons, and the major charm that increases fire damage. My kunai, Oni's flame, and blast bombs, all do major damage like this. You can one shot enemies with the kunai alone (not everything, but one tap after the kunai if they don't die). The armor also buffs stealth a bit, I'm having no issues tearing through camps by assassinating a few enemies, then exploiting all of my quickfire weapons. Charm of True Aim (I think it's called this) that lets you auto target 3 headshots with the Yumi bow is also insanely overpowerd. You can easily wipe out an entire camp in Yotei with a ranged setup, it's crazy strong just like it was in Tsushima.\n\nBosses/duels are another discussion. 🤣"

What other game tells you which way to go by showing you the way the leaves and blades of grass are blowing in the wind?\n\nLike yea, I get the sentiment - but the visuals of this game are quite literally a part of the gameplay, from the different aspect ratios depending on the context (horse, walking, combat, etc), to the breathtaking draw distance that just immerses you in the world.\n\nAnd before someone comes for my throat, yes the gameplay itself is very fun too. The combat feels punchy and has a lot of room for skill expression/build crafting. I already have 3 different builds, one for fighting, one for stealth and another for exploration.\n\nThe ONLY thing I don’t like are the non-scripted cutscene animations, but then again they are the exact same from Ghost of Tsushima and the actual pre-rendered cutscenes are breathtakingly beautiful.\n\nThe score is great, the main character is witty and fun to play as, the gore is top notch and the world is beautiful. People just want to hate because they read that one IGN article about “the same story over and over” and suddenly they know everything about the game.\n\nGoated game, OP.

It's like going from BOTW to TOTK but without the unique things that makes TOTK different enough.\n\nAnd no, I don't think Tsushima 2 would have been the the right solution.

An entertainment. A story a team of creators believes in. They want to make this.\" He reiterates that \"it's a game,\" and if anyone isn't a fan of it then they can simply not purchase it.\n\n> \"If you don't like it,\" Layden writes, \"don't buy it. In fact, why not make the game you want yourself?\" He makes a valid point, and one that many agree with. Amid complaints about the Ghost of Yotei protagonist, many more fans are excited about the sequel and the possibility of a female samurai. One discusses \"the history and legacy of samurai women,\" linking to a relevant historical study.\n\n> Another points fans toward documents on the onna-bugeisha or onna-musha, female warriors from pre-modern Japan who often fought alongside samurai men - and even led them. There's no telling just yet what path Ghost of Yotei will take with its plot, though, but a setting in Hokkaido over 300 years after the events from Ghost of Tsushima points to a possible tale of the Ainu people settled within the region."

They're certainly big enough to be working on multiple projects at once, and they've traditionally done that for a while now. \n\nSanta Monica also seem to be working on something new alongside the new mainline GOW which is presumably pretty far out still. Then there's also the rumoured metroidvania game which I'm guessing they'll have some level of input on. I'm guessing that's not far away based on the way people talk about it. In general I'd say they're not too bad for output lately, given it was only 4 years between their last 2 GOW games. But it will be nice to see something new from them\n\nFor many reasons, alot of the Sony studios output has been fairly sparse the last few years.

So I'm neither a genre or Sony hater but simply felt disappointed by the game. \nHappy for the people who enjoy it and wanted more though.\n\nNot you specifically, but it's disappointing when people in this comment thread are brushing off people as either culture war haters, general contrarians or haters towards console games or similar notions."

Two of them are full plot-lines, each with a new area of the map to explore. The others are just some one-off missions. Once you complete them, the game railroads you and progression becomes linear for the last section. \n\nI actually really like this way of doing things. Compared to BotW for example where the whole game is playable in any order so it feels like there is no story progression until literally the final boss. Or AC Shadows, which does a similar thing as Yotei but the non-linear portion of the game is so much longer than the linear parts that it just feels like a bunch of disconnected stories rather than chapters in a single story. \n\nYotei feels like the best of both worlds. There are parts that can be played in any order so it really does feel like you the player are hunting and following leads organically.

And further, you can go after any of the enemies right from the get-go, so it's not a linear story? I am concerned. On the face of it it sounds like a weaker story. What do people who have actually played it think? I find I need at least a half-decent story to enjoy a game even if the gameplay is stellar."

Even if they release numbers of  any sort, they'll spin them (like a certain company did recently talking about how many people were \"engaged\" with the game).  This will fuel both sides arguing.  You'll see people claiming it failed.  You'll see people claiming it has sold more than the first.  News reports claiming it's a massive success, touting paid shills giving high reviews.\n\nUltimately we're going to need to wait to accumulate numbers.  Unless it succeeds massively, in which case they'll advertise the numbers far and wide to 'own the chuds'.  Of course, if they don't advertise the numbers it doesn't mean that it failed massively either.\n\nIt's ultimately just guessing until the game numbers are forced out by investor calls, other company calls/press statements, or something similar.  Even then, companies like Ubisoft and EA have shown a willingness to attempt to hide actual numbers even when legally required to give them.  If they go private (\"if\"....lol, EA already has done, Ubisoft may follow) then the numbers reporting becomes even murkier.\n\nI understand the need to see want to celebrate the game failing.  I do.  Ultimately though you're going to have to take solace for a long while in your own decision to buy it or not, to point out what you might see as woke or worthy or not.  Maybe not the answer you want but trying to explain why you're likely to be disappointed in asking for concrete numbers unless the game turns out to be an absolutely massive, undeniable success story.\n\nPersonally I hope it fails.  Badly.  If only to repudiate a studio that put out Woke rubbish changes on purpose for no reason other than to push an ideology, and did things like hire developers who celebrated a man's murder.  But others may have a different opinion.  What you CAN take comfort in is that at least the numbers are known by the people in charge.  Hopefully if the game is a failure, heads will roll.  Perhaps a vain hope given how the Woke tend to fail upwards and avoid consequences, but a hope I have nonetheless."

Wenn man dann noch den meistens relativ schnellen Preisverfall und Rabattaktionen in den Stores betrachtet, beim PC die Möglichkeit von Keysellern dürfte man im Vergleich zu früher wahrscheinlich sogar zum Schluss kommen, das man heute günstiger an die Basisspiele kommt, als früher. (Abgesehen von Raubkopien)."

HFW on the other hand had the Relic Ruins which actually told a story while you traversed around various old world places, the Black Boxes which again had a narrative purpose and a cool gimmick, and the scanner drones which involved fun jumping puzzles.

I decided to go back to it a few weeks after I finished the main story and I'm so happy for it. It's been incredible so far. How the story progressed in such a natural way that was also surprising is beyond me. It's great. \n\nI attribute the success to scale rather than evolution. Yes the devs have obviously learned a lot after finishing the campaign but there's something to be said about scale. A giant massive world is enticing to the player but I'd argue it makes for a worse game. The limitation of a shorter runtime for a smaller world makes for a tighter experience. \n\nIf there's one thing Ubisoft takes from their current struggles, I hope they pull back on the scale. Being able to brag about an expansive world is one thing but being able to say your game is better for being smaller is another."

Early enemies survive 4 hits with a starting sword, late enemies survive 4 hits on a maxed out sword, and it does not feel like progression.

      "text": "The thing about Astrobot is it didn't emerge in a vaccuum. That demo was a perfect opportunity for Sony to not only test out a potential playerbase, but also proof of concept, generate hype, and sell the game. If anything is a missed opportunity, it's giving out tech demos for free. Look at Wii Sports. That was not only the best-selling Wii game of all time, that *literal demo* pushed actual Wii sales, with thousands-if not millions-of soccer moms and geriatric customers buying the Wii just to play bowling or tennis. And it directly led to Wii Sports Resort and a slew of sports-themed titles on the device for the entirety of its lifespan.\n\nIf Sony was truly serious about potentially bringing out a Sly Cooper remake, they should task SuckerPunch with creating a tech demo for their PS6 (or even just releasing it on the PS5) and give it out for free. See how many people actually like it. Why they like it. And maybe if there's enough buzz, a game could come out. \n\nBut as of right now, without any real data on how successful a Sly Cooper game would be, all they have to go off of is old gamers like us who remember the good old days and comment on Reddit. And we're not anywhere near a large enough number for a company like Sony."

Apart from the question marks and symbols on the map there’s absolutely nothing to discover. The graphics look great at first glance but somehow they all feel the same. The only things that occasionally differ are the colors of the flowers and the trees. Otherwise the visuals also feel low in detail and polygons. The NPCs don’t react to the player in a believable way. They feel more like lifeless shells just standing around. Quests always follow the same pattern. You follow someone. Someone is dead. You follow the footprints and find the killer. No matter if you sleep for two nights in between or not the killer is always just behind the next hill. The stealth mechanics aren’t anything special either. Splinter Cell already did that better back in the day.\n\nThe main story is great and the combat is fun even though it gets repetitive after a while.\n\nAside from that the game basically just consists of ticking off the same icons and tasks on the map. Kind of soulless.\n\nBut if it’s someone’s very first video game ever I can understand the hype since there’s no point of comparison to other real and living open worlds."

I’ll free a town here and there but i skipped all the side tales after the first few missions. I like they are tied to characters you interact with but the actual missions are very very boring. Look here, follow here, investigate over there, a small fight. \n\nAnyway I think I’ll finish this time and actually enjoy the game lot more.

The Yotei meme you refer to is an extreme exaggeration of normal beauty standards that a tall guy is not. There are some romance novels that do have an equivalent, where the guy is described as being eight feel tall, three refrigerators wide, with a dick like a battering ram, but that isn't the norm. The standard male love interest is much more akin to the default expectation that women in fiction be attractive, which Yotei's main character is. \n\nSecond, consider the type of products involved. The type of romance novel that has the kind of extreme exaggerations we're talking about will be heavily on the porn side. If you look at written erotica published for straight men, similar exaggerations are quite common. Ghosts of Yotei, in contrast, is a mainstream video game. \n\nThere cannot be a double standard if the two items aren't comparable."

I landed perfect parries semi-consistently, as in: I'm landing perfect parries often during the fight but struggle forcing them consciously.\n\nPersonally, I think the blue and red glint of unblockables is often too bright; covering the whole weapon and making it impossible to tell where the weapons are mid-swing, therefore making it hard to learn timings without a tell."

Whilst the 3d graphics looked good, the cutscenes lacked a lot of the dark noire flair that had made the original games so interesting, and the writing was extremely suspect in ways that went far beyond just the ending.\n\nIt was symptomatic of a wider trend within 'kid friendly' games these days: a lot of the visual design is just a lot less sophisticated conceptually. Another good example is the recent *Advance Wars: Re-Boot Camp* by Wayfarer when compared to the originals: the modern kid-friendly style is all about round shapes and flat, bright colours: stuff I literally learned in year one of my Visual Design module at uni. But these are games about thieves and war: the visual style completely undermines the themes."

It's just people being unable to see past the nostalgia they have for their formative years and gradually lose the ability to enjoy new things that they dont have that baked in nostalgia for, and they only remember the good things from that era and forget about all the bad things. There is no decline in artistic quality, only a decline in their ability to appreciate new things. As much as people say modern gaming sucks, probably over half my alltime top 10 games have come out in the last 10 years. Even in terms of sheer quantity, it's undeniable that there are way more games being released every year than there were 10 or 20 years ago. If you are finding you are not enjoying any new games you might need to broaden your horizons and try things you otherwise wouldn't. If triple a games have become uninteresting to you there is a wealth of amazing indie games doing all kinds of different things for you to try. I basically do nothing outside of work other than play games and I can still not even come close to keeping up"

The first game's story was actually unique to be about a man standing up against impossible odds to protect his people against the Mongol invasion in the 1200's. This story is actually very unique cause we don't see this scenario often.\n\n\nThe last time I saw something similar in a AAA game that involved the Mongol invasion was with a very old Altair that is nearly 90 and he knows his days are numbered. So he takes an Eden artifact and walls himself off to die with it so that they can't take it. This was a mini story within AC Revelations when Ezio is looking for this artifact."

He comes across as a canny operator and his argument with Aloy neatly ties up all the potentially gamified player motivations. The quest called Sea of Sands has some of the best intro dialogue of any quest in any game I've played, ever. I was strongly motivated to do those Oseram boys a solid and find their goodies after they explained their purpose. That one also has some amazing music, which would be the best in the game if it wasn't for The Roots That Bind. I mean, [this is just gorgeous.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c9SakcmZuA) \n\nYou can get through the entire game just fine without visiting every icon on the map, that stuff is just there if you're in the mood for completionist stuff. [Install this](https://www.nexusmods.com/horizonforbiddenwest/mods/50) and upgrade all your gear for free and you can skip all that grindy bullshit. The Ultra Hard difficulty is extremely well-balanced and makes the big set piece fights fun as hell.\n\nEDIT: I just remembered something important for PC players. There's a bug in the game when it renders sand blowing in the air, it comes out all pixelated and looks like shit. If you have a rig that can run the game without using FSR3 Frame Generation (which you *should* use if you've got a rig that struggles), XeSS anti-aliasing is the only thing I've found that fixes that problem. I have a 2060, and I can keep my frame rate above 50 fps with XeSS AA as long as texture quality is set to medium. I find that tolerable, however if you want higher frames than that, and you don't mind the ugly sand clouds, use [this mod,](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/738) run DLSS at the Quality setting, and turn on FSR3 Frame Generation. That mod is what lets you use both at once and it will get your frame rate around 120 on a 2060. FSR3 Frame Generation is basically magic and that mod works on a lot of other games. You don't need an AMD card to use it, like I said, it works great on my 2060."

It also has far less than Spider-Man.\n\nThe data should not be used for comparisons whatsoever because only less than 1% of the userbase uses PSNProfiles.\n\n\\[QUOTE\\]  \n\"Thats why they cannot even release something like SOLD 500K COPIES.\"\n\nThis is FALSE\n\n99% of the time, Sony waits at least a week before announcing sales first.\n\nHelldivers 2 - 3 months after launch  \nThe Last of Us Part II - 1 Week after launch  \nGhost of Tsushima - 1 week after launch  \nSpider-Man 2018 - 13 days later  \nGod of War - 13 days later\n\nThe best data comes from Mat Piscatella (US sales), Christopher Dring (European sales), and Famitsu/Media Create (Japanese physical sales).\n\nChristopher Dring will report on digital sales on Thursday/Friday, and he already stated that European sales are significantly higher than Ghost of Tsushima. With this data, we can estimate that it's similar around the world.\n\nWe can estimate and apply the same number when the Japanese physical sales are released this Thursday.\n\nMat Piscatella will report on the US sales on the 22nd of October. However, this report from Mat Piscatella will report on September sales, which includes data from August 31st through October 4th. This means at best, we should get a comparison for the first week's sales of Ghost of Tsushima and Ghost of Yotei."

Bushy literally went past the 2 loss derank prevention cap today and briefly went down to Depth 3. That's with a team he can actually verbally communicate with, and one he obviously knows personally.\n\nHell, I managed to queue two times without any sort of password with Dist (another souls streamer) - it feels like there really aren't that many people in Depth 4, let alone 5 if I had to wager - and I was in D5 before, just deranked on purpose to play with a buddy in D2 back then.\n\nSo yeah, it's tough. We all struggle sometimes and a big part of the climb is just luck for most of us. If you get ED Pest or Libra at D4 it's pretty much a guaranteed loss, while others may get to D5 by mostly getting Adel and Fulghor, and not even the Everdarks."

This is where the aforementioned political groups camouflaged themselves as concerned consumers to loudly fight against “diversity and inclusion” when their ultimate issue was not with poor product quality, but with inclusion of diversity itself. \n\nHowever, back when the products were “diverse” AND poorly made, these political operatives could easily blend in with the rest of the disgruntled consumers and claim that everyone criticizing the products belonged to “them”.\n\nThen the products improved. And more progressive media start to come out more consistently with high quality. \n\nFuriosa. That was a turning point imho. \n\nFor all intents and purposes a good movie with a believable female lead. The political groups attacked it relentlessly prior to release calling it “woke” and “girl boss”. Then when it came out and wasn’t either, they changed their tune to “oh well, maybe it wasn’t woke. But we’ve had so much wokeness in media, we’re just tired of female protags.”\n\nSo here we are now. Those who criticized lazy fake-diverse products are waking up to the company they’ve been keeping. “Hold on a minute… you people just genuinely don’t like diversity or inclusion, even when done well.

      "text": "Don't understand these comments glazing E33 saying it's better, while also saying they never actually played Yotei in tbe same breath 😅 but will share my opinion at the risk of getting down voted for going against the grain\n\nPlayed E33 up to the third act. Have put 25 hours into Yotei since it's release last week. Enjoy Yotei a lot more. Coming from someone who prefers turn based combat over action combat, and who didn't like Tsushima that much.\n\nBoth are great games, you won't go wrong with either, but here's my observations\n\nE33 has a great, emotional story, well written characters, and a unique theme. Good plot twists. As a story it's entertaining. And the combat is interesting because it is unique. But combined, the pacing feels way off for some reason. The adventuring/exploring is limited: there's an open world hub, and then a lot of linear regions that are built linearly, kind of maze-like with branching dead ends, and don't have a map, so these areas can be frustrating to play through when trying to experience the story as you may find yourself getting lost or facing encounters you're not ready for. The stress is added by the fact that there's not the ability to save at any time and the ability to heal the party is limited early game. Finally, players who like turn based combat usually like build varieties and tactical synergies, but this is bare bones there and relies on QTE mechanics which feel out of place. In summary, while E33 is a masterpiece in creative storytelling and should be praised for trying to innovate gameplay, there are flaws. I still enjoyed it but got to the point where I'd rather just watch the rest of the story than play through it.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Yotei is not Tsushma. Or Shadows. In world design it actually feels like playing Breath of the Wild for the first time. The story is beautifully executed and had me emotional in the first 5 hours. But the exploration is the best I've ever played, beating Zelda and Elden ring. The parallel to Zelda games is in how open and organic exploration is; because of the expansive world with incredibly long sight distances and unique destinations, as a player you want to go explore and discover, instead of the game telling you to. It's the most alive, realistic world I've ever played in; feels like RDR2's world evolved to the latest generation of consoles. And the writing has some lows but a lot of really high highs. Tsushima had a little bit more dynamic combat, but the gameplay loop felt repetitive because the player was being taken through narrow spaces to do the same quest over and over like ACO; Yotei isn't like that, it's more like \"here's 4 main objectives you're aware of immediately but you'll discover your own path along the way\" - again, just like BOTW.\n\nI hope the specifics help you with a decision. You won't go wrong either way, they're both great games. And there's nothing wrong with people preferring E33 who have played both. But I'm seeing a significant number of people comparing E33 to Tsushima, or to nothing, while calling it the better game lol"

Or you end up in a Tod Howard/Bethesda situation where the studio head has too many projects going at the same time to be able to provide the level of creative oversight they might desire.\n\nMore projects can definitely be a way to get more money, but definitely comes with more administrative overhead and some people simply dont want that.  Ken Levine's a great example.  Coming hot off the success of Bioshock Infinite one would think he's scale up Irrational Games to pursue even bigger projects or to be able to support multiple at the same time, but in his case, he chose to close it down so he could start over with a smaller team.  He's said that the leadership part of game dev is something he's always struggled with, and not to be uncharitable, but something he still seems to be struggling with as seen with Judas but I digress...\n\nSometimes staying a single title studio just aligns better for retaining certain levels of control over the course of the development cycle or even allowing someone to stay more focused on the bits of game dev they enjoy and less time doing suit stuff."

Atsu knows the Six are in Ezo, but as for where, that's up to her to find.  She wouldn't have a journal with exactly what she needs to do next, the map with objective pins is perfect for someone who is following tips and leads to find her targets.  This allows the game to let you really feel like a ronin, wandering through different areas and picking up rumors to investigate. \n\nI was turned off from the lack of a journal and mission list in Yotei for a little bit, but because of how the game works, I don't even notice it now."

      "text": "The fact is most players (not using busted and cheated relics) won't make it past depth 1. The fact that you're in depth 2, even if you were carried or not, means you're already better than average. Most good carries cannot hold a team together if one is lagging, so even tho they might be amazing at the game, that doesn't mean you aren't good.\n\nAnother extremely important point: Your skill in trios, even duos but to a lesser extent, is not as easily quantified. I forget where I read it, but it was a comment basically saying \"nightreign is harder on trios because it's balanced for 3 good players; if you think solo is easy, it's because solo is balanced for 1 good player\"\n\nSaid another way, if you found Nightreign easy solo, that means you're already a good player. In trios, and especially DoN, if the game is balanced for 3 good players, and you have one good player (you), one bad player, and one okay player, immediately you've increased the difficulty of the game.\n\nIf you want to see where you're at, derank to depth 1 and play solo. See how far you can get. Change your strategy a little bit as you go into higher depths.\n\nAssuming we take what I said above, we can quantify your skill somewhat by using your depth rank from DoN solo:\n1. Depth 1 - average/slightly above\n2. Depth 2 - good\n3. Depth 3 - very good\n4. Depth 4 - great\n5. Depth 5 - insane\n\nFrom there just play solo and have fun; that's what the game is about, after all!! Once you feel like you've hit a wall, I would just derank to the depth you thought was most fun solo, and then trio/duo queue. By the time you do that, you'll also have just gotten better than when you attempted that lower depth.\n\nIt's up to you tho; personally I enjoy some of the challenge, but past depth 4 I started to hit a wall and just not have as much fun. I might do a couple more games or create a backup save file, then derank to depth 2. Depth 3 was fun, but I remember enjoying depth 2 a lot more tho. At the end of the day, just ask yourself what's more important: grinding to depth 5, or having fun? (Not mutually exclusive)"

You dont have to worry about healing or buffing defense or debuffing any of your opponents attacks or managing status effects. There is no strategy to defense...its just playing the fight over and over again until you get the timing down to take zero damage.\n\nAnd you can't take out one half the equation without fucking up both halves. You optimize damage because you need to kill the opponent before they kill you.
